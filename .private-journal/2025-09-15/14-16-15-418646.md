## Project Notes

TASK_055 - Path Resolution Fix:

Codex (automated PR reviewer) found a critical bug that our code review missed: the canUseTool functions in both capture-plan.ts and claude-sdk.ts were rejecting valid relative paths because they expected absolute paths.

The issue: When Claude SDK agents send file paths like `.claude/tasks/TASK_055.md`, our validation was checking if an absolute path started with the allowed directory. This would always fail for relative paths.

The fix: Import `resolve` from node:path and resolve paths relative to the project root before checking. This handles both absolute and relative paths correctly:
```typescript
const filePath = resolve(projectRoot, requestedPath);
```

This was a great catch by Codex - the bug would have completely broken the feature in production since the SDK often sends relative paths.
