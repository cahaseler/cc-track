## Project Notes

The complete-task command is now more robust for iterative PR workflows. First run squashes, second run just pushes. This matches real development patterns where you get PR feedback and need to push fixes without losing the review history.

The test situation remains weak - the commands are hard to test because they're not designed with dependency injection. The hooks are much better in this regard. Future refactoring should consider making commands more testable by extracting the action logic into a separate function that accepts dependencies.
