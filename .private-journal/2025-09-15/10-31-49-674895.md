## Project Notes

TASK_054 successfully completed. The code review feature is now fully integrated into cc-track's prepare-completion workflow. 

The feature:
- Runs after validation passes
- Uses Claude SDK with Sonnet model for thorough analysis
- Writes reviews to code-reviews/ directory with proper naming
- Skips if review already exists (idempotent)
- Has comprehensive test coverage
- Follows existing dependency injection patterns

The automated review of the implementation itself confirmed all requirements were met with no critical issues. This feature will help maintain code quality by providing automated review before task completion.
