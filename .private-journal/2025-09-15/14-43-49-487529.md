## Project Notes

The cc-track test suite follows a consistent dependency injection pattern - all hooks accept a deps object with optional overrides. When writing new tests, always check if existing mock helpers are available. The pattern is: createMockX() functions that return properly typed mock objects. Tests should always mock: execSync, file operations, gitHelpers, githubHelpers, claudeSDK, logger, and config getters.
