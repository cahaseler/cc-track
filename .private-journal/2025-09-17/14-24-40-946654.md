## Project Notes

Wrapping up initial cc-track development after 5 days. The project has grown from a simple context management idea into a comprehensive workflow automation system. Key accomplishments:
- Successful pivot from cc-pars to cc-track branding
- Clean CLI architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Effective hook system for validation and automation
- Smart git/GitHub integration that actually works
- Configurable features to avoid being too opinionated

Craig's going to dogfood it on other projects now, which is the real test. Expecting to find edge cases around:
- Different project structures and conventions
- Git workflows that don't match our assumptions
- Performance issues with large codebases
- Hook conflicts with other tools

The codebase is in good shape for maintenance - tests are working (after that TypeScript test debacle), architecture is clean, and we have good documentation.
