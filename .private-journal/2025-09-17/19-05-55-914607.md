## Project Notes

Important architectural distinction in cc-track: There are "working" files (the source code we're building) vs "operational" files (the config we use to dogfood cc-track on itself). The code reviewer got confused between these - it thought we needed to fix an operational file (.claude/commands/setup-cc-track.md) when we actually needed to fix the template that generates it. This is a common source of confusion when a tool is being used to develop itself.
