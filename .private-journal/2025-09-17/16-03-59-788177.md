## Project Notes

The cc-track validation system has a clear pattern: each validation type (TypeScript, lint, tests, Knip) should check its enabled flag first. This bug likely existed since the TypeScript validation was first added - someone copied the structure but forgot the enabled check. The codebase has good test infrastructure with proper mocking utilities in test-utils/command-mocks.ts. The validation.ts file was previously untested, which is why this bug survived so long.
