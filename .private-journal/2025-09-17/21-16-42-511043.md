## Project Notes

Successfully diagnosed and fixed the GitHub API timing issue in complete-task. The problem wasn't a bug but a race condition - GitHub's API sometimes doesn't immediately recognize a pushed branch. Solution: 2-second delay after push + retry logic for PR creation. Simple, pragmatic fix that should eliminate these intermittent failures.
