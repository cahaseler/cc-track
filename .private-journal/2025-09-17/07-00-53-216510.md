## Project Notes

The cc-track project has excellent DI patterns throughout - only one test file (index.test.ts) was using mock.module instead of proper dependency injection. All other tests correctly pass mocked dependencies as parameters. The fix was minimal and surgical, demonstrating that the codebase is well-architected. The CI pipeline failures were a perfect example of how local testing can miss issues that only appear in different execution environments.
