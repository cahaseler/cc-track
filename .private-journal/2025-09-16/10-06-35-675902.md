## Project Notes

TASK_062 completed successfully. Improved type safety throughout the Claude SDK integration by using proper types from @anthropic-ai/claude-code package. No runtime changes, all tests pass. Code review approved with no blocking issues.

The codebase now has better type safety for SDK interactions, which will help catch errors at compile time and improve IDE autocomplete/suggestions.
