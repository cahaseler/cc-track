## Project Notes

The lint parser abstraction in cc-track is quite clean:
- `src/lib/lint-parsers.ts` defines the LintParser interface and three implementations
- Configuration uses a simple `tool` field to select parser
- The parsers handle both parsing output and generating auto-fix commands
- Tests are comprehensive with 17 test cases covering various output formats

The template config structure had to be updated from simple booleans to proper nested objects under hooks/features. This broke backward compatibility but since there are no existing users yet, we could make this breaking change cleanly.
