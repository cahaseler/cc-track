## Project Notes

TASK_063 Implementation Details

This task went incredibly smoothly after the initial CodeRabbit installation hurdle. The implementation followed established patterns perfectly:

- The code review abstraction in src/lib/code-review/ is clean and extensible
- All tests use the same DI pattern we've established throughout the codebase
- The CodeRabbit parser handles their complex output format well with state tracking
- Integration with prepare-completion was seamless - just replaced the direct call with the abstraction

The code review came back with zero issues, which validates that following established patterns consistently leads to quality implementations.

Craig was particularly insistent about proper testing - when I initially tried to skip tests he firmly corrected me. This reinforced that comprehensive testing is non-negotiable in this codebase.

The only hiccup was the TypeScript noExplicitAny error, which was easily fixed by proper type checking instead of using 'any'.
