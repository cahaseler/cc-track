## Project Notes

TASK_080 review complete. This is a significant feature adding integration testing infrastructure to cc-track. The implementation is sophisticated and follows good patterns but has critical security vulnerabilities that need immediate attention.

The task successfully delivers:
- Integration test infrastructure with temp projects and git repos
- Task lifecycle testing end-to-end
- Proper CI/CD integration
- Comprehensive mock systems

Critical issues requiring immediate fix:
- Shell command injection vulnerabilities 
- Path traversal attack vectors
- Global state pollution in tests

This represents a major step forward for the project's testing maturity once security issues are resolved.
