## Project Notes

The cc-track project has excellent code review integration via Claude SDK. The performCodeReview function provides thorough analysis including requirements alignment, security, performance, architecture, testing coverage. Reviews are stored in code-reviews/ directory. The capture-plan hook is complex but well-structured - handles GitHub issue creation, branch management, and task file enrichment. Good test coverage with 366 tests total. The project uses dependency injection consistently for testability.
