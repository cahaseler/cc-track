## Project Notes

cc-track integration testing complete. Created solid infrastructure in src/test-utils/integration-helpers.ts with temp git repos, project setup, hook execution. The task lifecycle tests in src/integration-tests/ validate real workflows end-to-end. 

Moved additional test categories to backlog after discussion with Craig - hook chains, git operations, context management, config propagation can be added later as needed. The core infrastructure is in place and working well.

The code review was overly pedantic about security in test utilities, but fixing the command escaping prevents CI security scanners from complaining. Everything else was justified pushback.
