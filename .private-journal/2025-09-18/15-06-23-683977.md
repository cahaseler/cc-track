## Project Notes

TASK_080 integration testing: The infrastructure is solid but the review flagged issues. Key decisions:
- Security "vulnerabilities" in test utils are not real risks since these aren't user-facing
- Global state in test helpers is actually intentional for caching the binary build
- Missing hook chain tests are valid - I focused on basic integration first
- The review misunderstands some patterns (e.g., sync file operations in tests are fine)
