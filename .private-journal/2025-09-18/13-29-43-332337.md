## Project Notes

cc-track has sophisticated testing infrastructure with createMockCompleteTaskDeps and other utilities in test-utils/command-mocks.ts. All tests currently mock external dependencies. 

The codebase is well-structured for integration testing:
- Clean DI patterns everywhere
- Clear separation of concerns
- Good existing test utilities that could be extended

Main challenges for integration testing:
- Claude SDK calls (would need to stub)
- GitHub API calls (would need mock or sandbox)
- Need temp directories and git repos
- Tests would be slower than current unit tests
