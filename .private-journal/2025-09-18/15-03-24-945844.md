## Project Notes

Starting code review for TASK_080 (Integration Testing Plan). This is a comprehensive task to add integration tests to cc-track. Need to examine:

1. The integration test infrastructure in src/test-utils/integration-helpers.ts 
2. The actual integration tests in src/integration-tests/task-lifecycle.test.ts
3. CI/CD changes to support binary building
4. Any other supporting files

The task requirements are extensive - creating infrastructure + 5 categories of tests covering real workflows. This looks like a substantial implementation that needs careful review for correctness, security, and maintainability.
