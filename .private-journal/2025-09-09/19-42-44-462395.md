## Project Notes

cc-pars is now functionally complete for the core error learning loop:
1. Pre-compact hook extracts error patterns
2. Learned mistakes file persists knowledge
3. Post-compact hook prompts documentation updates
4. Journal review ensures personal insights aren't lost

The system successfully extracted meaningful patterns like "always Read before Edit" which will prevent future failures. The batch analysis approach to Claude CLI is working much better than individual prompts.

Next potential improvements:
- Add context usage warnings based on 5-hour blocks
- Periodically prune overly specific learned mistakes
- Extract patterns to global CLAUDE.md as Craig suggested
