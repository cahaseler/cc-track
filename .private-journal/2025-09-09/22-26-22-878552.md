## Project Notes

The cc-pars deviation detection system is now fully operational with three key components:

1. **Stop Hook (stop_review.ts)**: Runs after every response, checks for changes, commits with [wip] prefix, and evaluates work against task requirements using Claude CLI.

2. **Git Session Utilities (git-session.ts)**: Provides commands for managing WIP commits - squashing, showing diffs, preparing for push. Notably does NOT allow direct reset without user approval.

3. **Hook Integration**: All hooks that call Claude CLI now run from /tmp to avoid recursion. Pre-compact and capture_plan hooks also updated.

The system successfully detects four categories:
- on_track: Work aligns, allow stop
- deviation: Off track, block and request fixes  
- needs_verification: Claiming completion without testing, block
- critical_failure: Broke something important, allow stop but warn

Performance consideration: No review when no changes, exits immediately to avoid overhead during conversations.
