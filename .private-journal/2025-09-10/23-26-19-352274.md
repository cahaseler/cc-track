## Project Notes

CLI Refactoring Progress Update (TASK_026):

Successfully completed major portions of the refactoring:
- All lib modules refactored with dependency injection (80 tests passing)
- Hooks being converted to pure functions with HookInput â†’ HookOutput pattern
- Craig caught me trying to simplify pre-compact hook - important lesson about refactoring

Key insight: "That's not how refactoring works" - must preserve ALL functionality, not simplify or "improve" during refactoring. The goal is to change structure while maintaining exact behavior.

Next critical step: Write comprehensive tests for pre-compact hook's complex ErrorPatternExtractor class and Claude CLI integration. This is the most complex hook and needs thorough testing.
