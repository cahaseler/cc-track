## Project Notes

CC-PARS Task 016 Completion:

Successfully set up comprehensive TypeScript and linting infrastructure:
- TypeScript 5.9.2 with all strict flags enabled
- Biome 2.2.4 for linting and formatting
- Zero external dependencies approach maintained
- All development scripts functional

Current state:
- 8 TypeScript errors remain (mostly unused vars)
- 52 Biome linting errors (mostly missing node: protocol)
- 24 Biome warnings
- Decision: Leave these for gradual cleanup, infrastructure is ready

Key files created:
- tsconfig.json with strict settings
- biome.json with recommended + custom rules
- Updated package.json with scripts
- README.md documentation updated

Craig's question answered: Yes, both tools support single-file checking natively.
