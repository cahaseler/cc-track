## Project Notes

The stop_review hook is detecting "deviation" but TASK_020 is already complete. The compaction summary explicitly stated the task was done and asked for new direction. The session-start-hook asked me to review and update documentation, which I did (though everything was already up to date). Need to understand what the actual expectation is here.
