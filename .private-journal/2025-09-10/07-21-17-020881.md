## Project Notes

CC-PARS Configuration System Implementation:
- Added model parameters to Claude CLI calls (Haiku for simple tasks, Sonnet for complex)
- Fixed statusline to handle missing data gracefully by omitting empty fields
- Created flexible configuration system that can be extended for future features
- All hooks now respect enable/disable settings without throwing errors
- Slash command provides natural language interface for configuration
- Config persists across sessions and applies immediately to new hook invocations
