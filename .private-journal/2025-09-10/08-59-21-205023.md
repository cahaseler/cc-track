## Project Notes

Post-compaction context restoration for cc-pars:
- Successfully updated TASK_009 documentation to reflect completion
- Added progress log entry for completed backlog system implementation  
- Updated code index with new backlog-related files
- The backlog system is now fully functional with dated entries

Key technical solution: The $ARGUMENTS variable in Claude Code slash commands must be quoted to preserve spaces and full argument text. Without quotes, only the first word is passed to the script.
