## Project Notes

CC-PARS non-task commit improvements:
- Removed unnecessary complexity with tracker files
- Now generates descriptive commit messages for all exploratory work
- Suggestion appears after 3+ consecutive non-task commits
- Uses shift-tab instruction for planning mode (not /plan)
- Clean implementation that just checks git history directly
