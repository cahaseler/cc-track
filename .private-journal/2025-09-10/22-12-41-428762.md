## Project Notes

Task 025 - GitHub Integration Implementation completed successfully!

This was a comprehensive feature addition that touched many parts of the cc-track system. Key implementation details:

1. **Configuration System**: Added github_integration feature with sub-options for fine-grained control
2. **GitHub Helpers Library**: Created comprehensive wrapper functions around gh CLI with proper error handling
3. **Hook Integration**: Modified capture_plan.ts to create issues when tasks are created
4. **PR Workflow**: Updated complete-task.ts to support both traditional merge and GitHub PR workflows
5. **Command Updates**: Enhanced complete-task.md with GitHub-specific instructions

The system gracefully handles the transition - since this task started before GitHub integration was enabled, there's no issue number, but the PR workflow is now active for future tasks.

Interesting edge case: The complete-task script correctly detected the GitHub PR workflow is enabled but since there's no issue, we'll merge traditionally this time.
