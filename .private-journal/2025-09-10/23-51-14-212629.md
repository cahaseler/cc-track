## Project Notes

Post-compaction restoration complete for TASK_026. Successfully updated documentation to reflect actual progress:

- All 5 hooks fully refactored as pure functions with comprehensive tests
- 162/165 tests passing (3 config tests fail due to Bun mock.module() isolation issue)
- Dependency injection pattern successful across entire codebase
- Ready to implement CLI entry point with Commander.js

Critical lesson from Craig: "you can't refactor a 339 line file when you've only read 200 lines of it" - I was being too conservative with context usage, trying to preserve it by reading partial files. For major refactoring work, must read FULL files even if it uses more context.

Test isolation issue is acceptable for now - we know the code works, it's just test infrastructure. Can revisit after completing the CLI implementation.
