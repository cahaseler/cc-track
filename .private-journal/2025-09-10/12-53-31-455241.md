## Project Notes

Task 016 - TypeScript and Linting Setup COMPLETED:

Successfully set up TypeScript with strict configuration and Biome for linting/formatting. Key accomplishments:
- Zero external dependencies approach (TypeScript + Biome only)
- All strict TypeScript flags enabled for maximum type safety
- Biome configured with recommended rules plus additional strictness
- Package.json scripts for easy development workflow
- Both tools support single-file checking as Craig asked

Single-file checking confirmed working:
- TypeScript: `bunx tsc --noEmit path/to/file.ts`
- Biome: `bunx biome check path/to/file.ts`

Identified but didn't fix:
- 8 TypeScript errors (mostly unused variables/declarations)
- 52 Biome linting errors (mostly missing node: protocol)
- 24 Biome warnings

This was the right approach - set up infrastructure first, cleanup can happen gradually.
