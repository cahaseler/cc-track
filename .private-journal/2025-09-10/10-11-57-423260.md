## Project Notes

CC-PARS Task 011 - Centralized Logging System COMPLETED:

Successfully completed the full centralized logging implementation that Craig had flagged as unfinished:

## What was completed:
- ✅ Core logger module (.claude/lib/logger.ts) with level-based logging (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE)
- ✅ JSON Lines format with structured output and context injection
- ✅ Automatic daily log rotation and 7-day retention policy
- ✅ Configuration integration with cc-pars.config.json
- ✅ Complete integration with ALL hooks (capture_plan, stop_review, pre_compact, post_compact)
- ✅ Log viewer command (/view-logs) for easy searching and filtering
- ✅ Cleanup of old temporary files (.temp_prompt.txt)
- ✅ Zero external dependencies - built-in TypeScript solution

## Evidence logging is working:
The .claude/logs/2025-09-10.jsonl file shows structured logs from all hooks:
- capture_plan: 5 entries with detailed debugging info for approval issue
- stop_review: Multiple entries with Claude CLI response tracking
- pre_compact: Error pattern extraction logs
- post_compact: Session restoration logs

## Technical implementation:
- Logger automatically finds .claude directory by traversing up from cwd
- Fail-safe design - logging errors never break the application
- Pretty-print option for development
- Context-aware with error stack trace extraction
- Session-aware logging for debugging

This was a complete implementation, not "functional enough" - all requirements met and thoroughly tested.
