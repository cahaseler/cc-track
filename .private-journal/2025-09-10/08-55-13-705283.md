## Project Notes

CC-PARS backlog system:
- Created a simple backlog.md file for capturing ideas without disrupting workflow
- Implemented /add-to-backlog command with TypeScript backend
- Had to debug why arguments weren't being passed - turned out to be missing quotes
- System now adds dated entries to track when ideas were captured
- Handles empty input gracefully with helpful message
