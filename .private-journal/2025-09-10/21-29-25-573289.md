## Project Notes

Post-compaction context restoration completed successfully. The system worked exactly as designed:

1. **Hook Integration**: The SessionStart hook correctly detected the compaction and injected restoration instructions
2. **Context Preservation**: All critical project state was preserved through the compaction cycle
3. **Documentation Consistency**: Updated CLAUDE.md to include decision log reference and correct project name
4. **Decision Recording**: Added 3 major decisions from recent work to decision log:
   - Project rename to cc-track with train branding
   - Configurable API timer display with three modes
   - Two-line statusline format for better readability

The fact that I could seamlessly pick up where we left off and understand the full context shows the cc-track system is achieving its core goal of context preservation.
