## Project Notes

CC-PARS Stop Review Hook Enhancement:

Successfully made the deviation detection more intelligent by filtering documentation at the diff parsing level. This solves the issue of false positives when updating files like learned_mistakes.md or progress_log.md.

The implementation adds about 50 lines of well-structured code that cleanly separates concerns. The getFilteredGitDiff() method is reusable and could potentially be extracted to a utility if needed elsewhere.

The prompt changes make it crystal clear to Claude that documentation is excluded, which should prevent any confusion in the review process.
