## Project Notes

Task 019 - Clean Up Progress Log Noise:

Successfully removed noise from the progress log system. The key insight was that "Started" entries for task creation added no value - the task files themselves already track when tasks are created. 

Removed 17 "Started" entries and stopped the capture_plan hook from creating new ones. The progress log is now much cleaner (104 lines vs ~174) and only contains meaningful status changes like Completed, Abandoned, Blocked, etc.

This was a simple but important quality-of-life improvement that makes the progress log actually useful for tracking real progress rather than administrative noise.
