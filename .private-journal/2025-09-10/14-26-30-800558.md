## Project Notes

CC-PARS now has comprehensive type safety and linting:
- Zero TypeScript errors with strict mode
- Zero Biome warnings (all rules set to error)
- All Node.js imports use `node:` protocol
- No `any` types remaining in the codebase
- Proper interfaces for all complex types

The autofix tools worked perfectly - they only made safe, correct changes. My initial panic about "deleted methods" was completely unfounded. The project is now in excellent shape for future development with strong type safety guarantees.
