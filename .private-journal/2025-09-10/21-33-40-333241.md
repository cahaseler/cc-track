## Project Notes

Documentation Alignment Completed:

Successfully updated product_context.md and code_index.md to reflect actual implementation rather than outdated descriptions. Key corrections:

1. **Product Context Fixes**:
   - Quality Assurance: Changed from "batched edit validation (every 3 edits)" to "real-time edit validation" - reflects PostToolUse hook implementation
   - Developer Experience: Updated to mention two-line statusline, train theming, cost tier emojis
   - Added train emoji examples (🚅 🛤️) and cost progression (🪙→🤑)
   - Fixed git integration description from "no version control" to "optional git branching"

2. **Code Index Fixes**:
   - Updated all paths to use actual .claude/ structure instead of missing top-level directories
   - Added missing files: edit_validation.ts, complete-task.ts, logger.ts, view-logs.md, test-args.md
   - Fixed hook locations from hooks/ to .claude/hooks/

3. **System Patterns Fixes**:
   - Corrected template directory reference
   - Updated command pattern path to .claude/commands/

The documentation now accurately describes what we actually built rather than early assumptions.
