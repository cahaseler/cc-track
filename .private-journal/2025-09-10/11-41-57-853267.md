## Project Notes

CC-PARS task completion status for multiple related tasks:

TASK_015 - Test Fixed Approval Detection: ✅ COMPLETED
- Successfully verified the capture_plan hook approval detection fix
- Logs confirm proper detection of plan field and task creation
- Centralized logging working correctly

TASK_014 - File consolidation debug: ✅ COMPLETED  
- Added debug logging to diagnose hook issues
- Revealed file path problems that led to consolidation
- Emergency logging to /tmp helped track execution flow

TASK_013 - Debug logging validation: ✅ COMPLETED
- Comprehensive debugging setup for capture_plan
- Identified missing config imports causing logger failures
- Validated centralized logging integration

TASK_012 - Investigation of hook failures: ✅ COMPLETED
- Discovered capture_plan was creating tasks but logging silently failed
- Root cause was missing config import preventing logger initialization
- Led to file consolidation effort

All these tasks were interconnected debugging efforts that ultimately:
1. Fixed the core approval detection bug (success -> plan field)
2. Consolidated duplicate hook files 
3. Established working centralized logging
4. Validated the entire capture_plan workflow

The debugging tasks (012, 013, 014) served their purpose and can be closed out along with the main fix validation (015).
