## Project Notes

Post-compaction workflow gap discovered:

After compaction and restoration, we need to pull latest changes from GitHub before proceeding. The current workflow:
1. Compaction happens
2. Context is restored 
3. Documentation is updated
4. BUT - we're potentially missing commits from GitHub (like merged PRs)

This was discovered when TASK_025.md didn't exist locally but was in the merged PR #1. A simple `git pull origin master` fixed it immediately.

The fix should be added to the post_compact hook or the SessionStart restoration instructions - automatically pull latest after compaction to ensure we're in sync with remote.
