## Project Notes

cc-track rename is complete and successful. The system now has cohesive branding throughout:

- Project name: cc-track (Task Review And Context Keeper)
- Tagline: "Keep your vibe coding on track"
- Config: track.config.json (not cc-track.config.json - cleaner)
- Commands: /init-track, /config-track
- Visual identity: 🚅 for active status, 🛤️ for "on track" status
- Cost tier emojis: 🪙 (<$50), 💵 ($50+), 💸 ($100+), 💰 ($200+), 🤑 ($300+)
- Burn rate: 🔥 appears when over $20/hr

The stop hook now uses "🛤️ Project is on track" instead of "✅ Work appears on track" - maintaining brand consistency without being heavy-handed.

All 51 files with cc-pars references were updated (excluding git history and journal entries). The only remaining cc-pars references are in the directory name itself, which we intentionally kept to avoid disrupting the git repo.
