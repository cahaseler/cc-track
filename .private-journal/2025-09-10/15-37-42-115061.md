TASK_020: PostToolUse Hook for Edit Validation

Successfully implemented a PostToolUse hook that runs TypeScript and Biome checks on edited files. The hook triggers after Edit, Write, or MultiEdit operations on TypeScript files and provides immediate feedback to Claude about any errors found.

Key implementation details:
- Hook reads tool_input to extract file paths based on tool type
- Filters to only check .ts/.tsx/.mts/.cts files
- Runs TypeScript and Biome checks in parallel for speed
- Uses hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext to provide error feedback
- Highly configurable with separate enable flags for hook, typecheck, and lint

Performance testing showed:
- TypeScript: ~1.3-1.4 seconds per file
- Biome: ~60-160ms per file
- Total execution well under 5 second timeout

The hook is opt-in by default (disabled) to not affect existing users. Configuration is managed through cc-pars.config.json with full control over commands and enablement.
