## Project Notes

CC-PARS git branching feature:
- Successfully integrated git workflow into task management
- The feature is optional and defaults to disabled (good for backwards compatibility)
- Branch names include task ID for uniqueness (feature/name-task008)
- Branches are kept after merge for reference (Craig's preference)
- Auto-commit of uncommitted work prevents losing changes when switching branches
- The complete-task command now handles branch merging seamlessly
