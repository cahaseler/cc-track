## Project Notes

TASK_045 Successfully Completed!

Fixed the last remaining test issue - the test was expecting maxTurns: 1 but we had changed the implementation to use maxTurns: 20 to give Claude sufficient turns for investigation. Simple fix: updated the test expectation to match the implementation.

All validation now passes:
- ✅ All 273 tests passing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation clean
- ✅ Biome linting clean
- ✅ No unused code issues blocking completion

The pre-compact hook rewrite is complete and ready for production. It's a much cleaner, more valuable implementation than the original error pattern extraction.
