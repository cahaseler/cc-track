## Project Notes

Task 043 - DiffSummary Integration Complete:

Added intelligent diff compression to stop-review hook:
- compressDiffForReview() method with 8KB chunk splitting
- Parallel processing with max 5 concurrent API calls
- Fallback to truncated diff when all chunks fail
- ~80% token reduction for diffs >5KB

Testing insight: Original test expected large diffs to fail, but Craig pointed out this was testing the wrong thing - the whole point was to handle large diffs correctly, not fail on them. Updated test to verify compression works instead of failing.

All 37 stop-review tests passing, full test suite passing.
