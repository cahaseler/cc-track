## Project Notes

TASK_039 Completion - SDK Integration Successfully Future-Proofed

**Final Status:**
- All tests passing (245/245)
- Build successful
- TypeScript compilation clean
- Linting passes
- Production hooks working correctly

**Critical Fix Applied:**
Removed hardcoded model versions from both tests and production code. The SDK now uses generic model names that automatically resolve to latest versions.

**Validation Completed:**
- Built project successfully
- Tested hook execution
- Verified TypeScript compilation
- Confirmed linting passes
- All unit tests passing

This task is now truly complete with a future-proof implementation that won't break when older models are deprecated.
