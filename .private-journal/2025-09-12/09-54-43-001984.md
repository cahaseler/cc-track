## Project Notes

TASK_033 Two-Phase Workflow Implementation:

Successfully implemented the two-phase task completion workflow after compaction recovery. Key insights:

1. **Architectural Evolution**: The initial approach of creating validation-checks as a CLI command was unnecessary overhead. Craig's suggestion to "just use the function" led to a cleaner architecture where validation logic lives in lib/validation.ts as a reusable function.

2. **Test Output Pollution**: Discovered that bun test output was polluting JSON responses. Solution was to redirect test output to /dev/null when checking pass/fail, then re-run with output only on failure for error reporting.

3. **Benefits of the Two-Phase Approach**:
   - prepare-completion provides clear, actionable feedback about what needs fixing
   - Dynamic instructions based on actual validation results
   - Leverages existing stop-review hook for automatic commits
   - Clean separation between validation/fixes and mechanical completion

4. **Validation Framework**: Now have comprehensive validation checking TypeScript, Biome, tests, and Knip (unused code). Each provides appropriate error details and counts.

The workflow is ready for production use and should significantly improve the task completion experience.
