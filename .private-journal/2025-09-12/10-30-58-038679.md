## Project Notes

TASK_034 GitHub Issue Creation Fix:

Successfully debugged and fixed a two-layer problem:

**Layer 1 - Validation Issue:**
- `isGitHubRepoConnected` was using `gh repo view 2>/dev/null` 
- The stderr redirection didn't work properly with execSync
- Fixed by removing redirection and adding explicit shell option

**Layer 2 - Command Escaping Issue:**  
- GitHub issue creation was interpreting backticks in markdown as shell commands
- Task content like `isGitHubRepoConnected` was being executed as commands
- Fixed by properly escaping quotes, backticks, and dollar signs

**Debugging Process:**
- Logs showed validation failures initially, then after fixing that, command escaping failures
- The error messages (/bin/sh: 1: isGitHubRepoConnected: not found) clearly indicated shell interpretation
- Testing with direct function calls helped isolate that validation logic worked, pointing to integration layer issues

GitHub issue creation now works end-to-end. The Plan -> GitHub Issue -> Task Branch workflow is fully operational.
