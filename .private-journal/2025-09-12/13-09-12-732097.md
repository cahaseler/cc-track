## Project Notes

The prepare-completion command now properly passes validation feedback to Claude instead of causing hard errors. This was a simple but important fix - just changing the exit codes from 1 to 0. The command still provides all the same detailed feedback about what needs to be fixed, it just doesn't block the workflow with bash errors anymore.
