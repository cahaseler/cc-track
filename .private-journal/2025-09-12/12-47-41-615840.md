## Project Notes

The edit-validation hook is now properly validating TypeScript files using the project's tsconfig.json settings. Performance is acceptable at 0.3-0.5s. The hook architecture is well-designed - it's easy to modify individual validation functions without affecting the rest of the system.

The test suite for the validation hook is comprehensive and caught the issues when we updated the implementation. Good test coverage pays off when making these kinds of changes.
