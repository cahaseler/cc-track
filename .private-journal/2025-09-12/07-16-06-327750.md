## Project Notes

The cc-track project now supports configurable default branches via git.defaultBranch in track.config.json. This allows projects to specify their preferred default branch ('main', 'master', 'develop', etc.) rather than relying on detection. The detection logic remains as a fallback: check git remote HEAD → check for local 'main' → check for local 'master' → default to 'main'.

We haven't actually migrated this repository to 'main' yet - that's phase 2 which involves creating the branch, updating GitHub settings, and updating .releaserc.json.
