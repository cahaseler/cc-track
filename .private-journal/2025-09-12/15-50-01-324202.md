## Project Notes

TASK_039 SDK Migration - COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!

**MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED:**
- Successfully completed the Claude Code TypeScript SDK migration
- All tests now pass without any timeouts or real API calls
- Codex completed the remaining edge case work while I was away
- All success criteria met:
  ✅ SDK installed and working with Pro subscription
  ✅ All CLI calls replaced with SDK calls
  ✅ All functionality works identically
  ✅ Performance improved (no temp files, no subprocess overhead)
  ✅ ALL tests properly mocked and passing

**KEY TECHNICAL INSIGHTS CONFIRMED:**
- Dependency injection pattern works perfectly for SDK mocking
- The critical issue was the claude-sdk.ts wrapper using static calls instead of instance methods
- Once that was fixed, the mocking system worked flawlessly
- Tests are now parallel-safe and fast

**FINAL STATUS:**
- All 4 test files completely passing
- No more hanging tests or real API calls
- SDK migration provides foundation for advanced features like controlled agents
- No regression in existing functionality

This was a complex migration that went through multiple phases and debugging sessions, but the final result is exactly what was needed.
