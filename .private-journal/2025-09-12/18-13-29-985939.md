## Project Notes

Log Parser Utility Successfully Implemented:

Created a comprehensive JSONL log parser for Claude Code transcripts with:
- Filtering by time range, role (user/assistant/system), and message limit
- Output in JSON or human-readable plaintext
- Simplification of complex nested structures
- Tool use/result summarization
- Integration with stop-review hook for recent message extraction

The implementation uses stream processing for efficiency and follows the established dependency injection patterns. All 255 tests pass, including the new parser tests.

This utility will be valuable for analyzing Claude Code sessions and could be extended later for the pre-compact hook to do more sophisticated context extraction.
