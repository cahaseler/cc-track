## Project Notes

The stop-review hook is a critical part of cc-track's quality assurance system. It reviews changes at stop points and can block continuation if work has deviated from task requirements. Understanding that it needs multiple turns occasionally (perhaps when parsing large diffs or handling complex review scenarios) is important for maintaining reliability. The hook already has good error handling - if the review fails entirely, it returns a review_failed status but still creates a commit to preserve work.
