## Project Notes

The cc-track workflow now has cleaner separation:
- prepare-completion: validation + documentation (when validation passes)
- complete-task: git operations + PR creation

This prevents the main branch merge conflict issue that could happen when documentation updates were prompted after switching back to main. The workflow itself serves as the test - when we complete this task, we'll be using the very workflow we just fixed.
