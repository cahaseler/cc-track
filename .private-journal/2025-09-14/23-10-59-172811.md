## Project Notes

cc-track's capture-plan hook now prevents accidental task proliferation by detecting active tasks. This enforces single-task focus which should improve task completion rates. The systemMessage pattern for communicating with Claude during hook execution is powerful - it allows hooks to guide Claude's behavior dynamically.

The task status progression makes more sense now: tasks start as "in_progress" (not "planning"), move through implementation, and end at "completed". This aligns with actual workflow.
