## Project Notes

cc-track cross-platform support is now comprehensive:
- Slash commands in src/commands/slash-commands/ use portable `cc-track` command
- Templates reference global command, not hardcoded paths
- Init command removed entirely (will be rebuilt for proper installation flow)
- All OS-specific code has been made portable
- 270 tests all passing after removing init command tests
