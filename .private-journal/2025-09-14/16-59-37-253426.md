## Project Notes

TASK_048 successfully implemented the npm distribution system for cc-track. The solution is elegant - everything is embedded at build time, no runtime file resolution needed. 

Dev versions 1.0.0-dev.1 and 1.0.0-dev.2 were published for testing. The system is now ready for automated releases via semantic-release when pushing to main branch.

The private journal MCP integration was added as a configurable feature that gracefully handles presence or absence of the MCP.
