## Project Notes

cc-track installation redesign: Moving from local binary installation to npm global package. The init command will create a minimal slash command that bootstraps the full setup via Claude. This aligns with the project's philosophy of transparency and Claude-as-collaborator.

Current structure:
- Commands live in .claude/commands/
- Templates in templates/
- Binary built with bun compile
- GitHub releases include Linux/Windows binaries

New model needs to:
- Package everything for npm distribution
- Make templates/commands accessible from global install location
- Create a bootstrap slash command that gives Claude everything needed
