## Project Notes

The pushCurrentBranch fix solves a recurring pain point where complete-task would fail after semantic-release added commits. The solution uses a fetch-check-rebase-push flow that handles most cases automatically. Tests cover: simple push, diverged with successful rebase, behind only, rebase conflicts with abort, push failures, and fetch failures. All tests passing, TypeScript and Biome checks clean. This should significantly improve the developer experience by removing a frequent manual intervention step.
