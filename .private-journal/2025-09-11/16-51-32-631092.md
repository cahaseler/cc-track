## Project Notes

CC-Track Semantic Release Architecture Complete:

Core deliverables implemented:
- Semantic-release with GitHub Actions (✅)
- Cross-platform binary builds via Bun targets (✅) 
- Conventional commit format across all generation points (✅)
- Task ID preservation in commit messages (✅)
- Automated release workflow triggered on master push (✅)

Key files modified/created:
- .releaserc.json: semantic-release configuration
- .github/workflows/release.yml: GitHub Actions workflow
- package.json: cross-platform build scripts
- src/lib/git-helpers.ts: conventional commit generation
- src/hooks/stop-review.ts: task ID inclusion in commits
- src/commands/complete-task.ts: config key bug fix

The system now automatically:
1. Analyzes conventional commits (feat/fix/BREAKING CHANGE)
2. Determines semantic version bumps
3. Builds Linux/Windows binaries
4. Creates GitHub releases with changelogs
5. Attaches cross-platform executables

Next commit to master will trigger first automated release!
