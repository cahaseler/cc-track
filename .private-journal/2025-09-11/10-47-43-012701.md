## Project Notes

TASK_026 Functionality Restoration Complete:

Successfully restored ALL missing functionality identified in command_functionality_differences_codex.md:

✅ **Complete-Task Command** (404→420 lines)
- Full CompletionResult JSON output format
- Configuration-driven validation (TypeScript, Biome, Knip)  
- GitHub PR workflow with branch pushing
- no_active_task.md completed tasks tracking
- Safe git squashing with all original safeguards
- Branch merging for both PR and local workflows
- Command options: --no-squash, --no-branch, --message

✅ **Init Command** (190→240 lines)  
- Smart CLAUDE.md merging with backup (not destructive overwrite)
- Proper settings location (claude_code_settings.json with template selection)
- Original directory structure preserved + new additions
- Template selection with --with-stop flag
- Backup handling with --no-backup option
- Command template copying (improvement from refactor)

✅ **Git-Session Utilities** (new 230-line implementation)
- show-revert: Display revert commands
- squash: Manual squashing with custom message
- show-wip: Display WIP commits  
- diff: Show session changes
- prepare-push: Squash + lint + test workflow

All implemented as proper CLI subcommands with logging, error handling, and tests. Craig confirmed these utilities have real debugging value when workflows go wrong.

Final result: 191 tests passing, 0 linting errors, full backward compatibility maintained.
