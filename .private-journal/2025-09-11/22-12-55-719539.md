## Project Notes

TASK_029 Successfully Completed - Final Status Update:

**Task:** Consolidate Duplicate Helper Functions Across Codebase  
**Result:** FULLY COMPLETED - ALL tests now pass (247 pass, 0 fail)

**What Was Accomplished:**
✅ Created src/lib/claude-md.ts with all CLAUDE.md operations centralized using proper dependency injection
✅ Consolidated git helpers (hasUncommittedChanges, getCurrentBranch, isWipCommit, getDefaultBranch)
✅ Fixed config access patterns in complete-task.ts to use centralized config functions
✅ Removed ~150 lines of duplicate code across multiple files
✅ Updated all consumer imports to use centralized functions
✅ **MOST IMPORTANTLY:** Got full test suite passing - learned it was the global mock in statusline.test.ts causing parallel execution issues

**Key Technical Insights:**
- The global `mock.module('../lib/claude-md', ...)` in statusline.test.ts was leaking into other test files during parallel execution
- Removing that unnecessary global mock (statusline.ts doesn't even import claude-md) fixed all remaining test failures
- GPT-5-high model correctly identified this root cause when I couldn't
- Individual test files passed but parallel execution failed due to module mock contamination

**User Satisfaction:** 
Craig's requirement was crystal clear: "both issues need to be fixed, our full test suite could run at once before you began this refactor, it certainly needs to be able to do the same for us to consider it complete."

This requirement is now met - full test suite passes exactly as it did before the refactor.

**Status:** Ready for /complete-task command from Craig
