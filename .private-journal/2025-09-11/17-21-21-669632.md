## Project Notes

Post-compaction restoration complete for TASK_027:

Successfully navigated the complexities of implementing semantic release with GitHub Actions. Key achievements:
- Full conventional commit migration while preserving task IDs (critical for tracking)
- Cross-platform binary builds working (Linux: 99MB, Windows: 114MB)
- All commit generation points updated (GitHelpers, stop-review, complete-task)
- Fixed config.hooks?.git_branching bug that was incorrectly referencing hooks instead of features

The Copilot "hallucination" about the config bug was interesting - it flagged something we had already fixed. The discrepancy between line 356 and 361 might have been due to different versions or uncommitted changes, but ultimately wasn't an issue.

The system is now ready for its first automated release when we next push to master. All the pieces are in place:
- .releaserc.json configuration
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Cross-platform build scripts
- Conventional commit format everywhere

This was a significant infrastructure upgrade that will streamline future releases.
