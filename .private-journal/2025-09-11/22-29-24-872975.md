## Project Notes

Post-Compaction Update Complete:

Successfully updated project documentation after resolving the merge conflict. Key items addressed:
1. Added TASK_029 completion entry to progress_log.md 
2. Fixed duplicate "Key Achievement" line that was mistakenly appended
3. TASK_029 already marked as completed in its task file
4. GPT-5-high escape hatch already documented in global CLAUDE.md

The merge conflict resolution went smoothly - kept both sets of backlog items including the new entry about renaming master to main.

Current state: All documentation is up to date, TASK_029 is fully completed and merged, and we're back on master branch with a clean working directory.
