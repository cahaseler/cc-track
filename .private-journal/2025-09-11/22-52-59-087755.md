## Project Notes

## TASK_030 Completion Reflection

Successfully completed all three improvements that started from the backlog:
1. Private journal filtering in stop-review
2. Edit-validation test file handling (was already working, just needed rebuild)
3. False positive task warning fix

The task went smoothly with no major obstacles. Key accomplishment was applying the dependency injection pattern learned from TASK_029 to avoid test contamination.

The automated /complete-task command worked perfectly, handling all the mechanical updates. The GitHub PR workflow is now well-established - created PR #6 successfully.
