## Project Notes

CC-Track CLI Architecture Insights:

The refactored architecture is much cleaner:
- Single entry point (cli/index.ts) with Commander.js
- Hook dispatcher automatically routes based on hook_event_name and tool_name (no redundant --type param)
- All hooks are pure functions that return results, hook command handles stdout/stderr/exit codes
- Compiled binary at dist/cc-track (~95MB) includes all dependencies

Key gotcha: Command markdown files need explicit Bash permissions in frontmatter like `Bash(/path/to/binary:*)` or commands get blocked.

Stop hook now automatically stages untracked files before review - this was a gap we discovered during testing. The hook was missing new files because they weren't staged.

Edit validation works perfectly now - blocks on TypeScript/Biome errors and shows them inline. Had to fix the tool_response check since Edit/Write don't have a success field.
