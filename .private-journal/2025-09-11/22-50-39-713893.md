## Project Notes

## TASK_030 Post-Compaction Summary

Successfully completed all three improvements in the task:

1. **Private Journal Filtering**: Added `.private-journal/` and `.embedding` file filtering to stop-review hook's `getFilteredGitDiff()` method. Files remain in git but are excluded from code review.

2. **Edit Validation Fix**: Discovered the hook already skipped test files correctly - the issue was just that the CLI binary hadn't been rebuilt after earlier changes. A simple rebuild fixed it.

3. **Task Warning Fix**: Fixed the false positive "commits without an active task" warning by:
   - Making `getActiveTaskId()` public (was private)
   - Checking for active task existence before showing warning
   - Adding comprehensive test coverage

Key technical insight: Used dependency injection pattern with mocked claudeMdHelpers to avoid the module mock contamination issue from TASK_029. All 249 tests pass.

The task went smoothly with no major obstacles. The compaction summary was very thorough and helpful in understanding what had been done.
