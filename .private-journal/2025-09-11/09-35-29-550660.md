## Project Notes

Stop-review Hook Refactoring Issue:

The refactored stop-review hook is not handling large diffs correctly. When the diff exceeds 50KB (current diff is 519KB), the hook throws an error "Diff too large for review" and returns `{success: true}` from the catch block.

The original implementation would still create a [wip] commit even when the review failed due to large diff. The refactored version is missing this behavior - it just returns success without committing.

Need to fix the logic to:
1. Still create the [wip] commit when diff is too large
2. Use an auto-generated message like "[wip] Changes too large for review - auto-commit"
3. Maintain the same behavior as the original script

The issue is in src/hooks/stop-review.ts around line 630-650 where the error is caught but no commit is made.
