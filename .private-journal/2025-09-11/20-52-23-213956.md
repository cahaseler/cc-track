## Project Notes

TASK_029 Helper Function Consolidation - Post-Compaction State:

From the compaction summary and test failures, I can see significant work was done on consolidating duplicate helper functions:

**Completed Work:**
- Added `isWipCommit` function to git-helpers.ts 
- Created new `src/lib/claude-md.ts` with centralized CLAUDE.md operations:
  - `getActiveTaskFile`, `getActiveTaskId`, `getActiveTaskContent`
  - `setActiveTask`, `clearActiveTask`, `getActiveTaskDisplay`
- Updated consumers: git-session.ts, complete-task.ts, stop-review.ts, statusline.ts
- Removed duplicate implementations from individual files
- Fixed config access in complete-task.ts to use config library
- Removed ~150 lines of duplicate code

**Current Issues (from test failures):**
- statusline.test.ts: getCurrentBranch mock not working properly - expects "feature/new-feature" but gets ""
- statusline.test.ts: generateStatusLine test expecting "main" in output but only getting task info
- stop-review.test.ts: Import error - trying to import `hasUncommittedChanges` from stop-review.ts but it was moved to git-helpers
- Some git-helpers.test.ts errors with branch creation/merging tests

**Status:** Major refactoring largely complete, but tests need fixing to match new centralized architecture.
