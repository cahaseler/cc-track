## Project Notes

TASK_029 Root Cause Analysis - Current State:

**Status:** NOT COMPLETE - tests fail when run together (173 pass/4 fail/4 errors)
**All individual test files pass** when run alone - the issue only occurs with concurrent execution

**Progress Made:**
✅ Fixed dependency injection in capture-plan.ts (updateClaudeMd function)
✅ Fixed dependency injection in post-compact.ts (using local extractActiveTaskFile)
✅ Improved from 154 pass/5 fail/5 errors to 173 pass/4 fail/4 errors
✅ All consolidation functionality works correctly when tested individually

**Remaining Issue:** Module loading race condition in parallel test execution
- Error: "Export named 'ClaudeMdHelpers' not found in module '/home/ubuntu/projects/cc-pars/src/lib/claude-md.ts'"
- Only happens when multiple test files import claude-md.ts concurrently
- Tests passed before consolidation, so this is MY regression to fix

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
The src/lib/claude-md.ts module structure I created has timing issues when multiple tests try to import simultaneously. Even though all exports exist, Bun's test runner can't resolve them consistently in parallel execution.

**Next Steps:** Need to fix the module structure to handle concurrent imports properly.
