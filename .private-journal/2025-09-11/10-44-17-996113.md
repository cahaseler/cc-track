## Project Notes

Git Session Utilities Analysis:

The original git-session.ts provides these utilities:
1. show-revert-command - Shows command to revert to last non-WIP commit
2. squash-session <message> - Squash WIP commits with provided message  
3. show-wip - Display all WIP commits
4. diff-session - Show changes since last user commit
5. prepare-push <message> - Squash WIPs and run quality checks

These are power-user utilities for git workflow management. The complete-task command now includes the core squashing functionality, so the gap is mainly:
- Manual squashing with custom message (vs automatic in complete-task)
- Diagnostic utilities (show-wip, diff-session, show-revert-command)  
- prepare-push workflow (squash + lint + test)

Question for Craig: Are these utilities actually used in practice, or can they be deprioritized? The core functionality (automatic squashing on task completion) is preserved.
