## Project Notes

TASK_028 - Remove Legacy .claude Scripts:

This was a straightforward cleanup task that went smoothly. Deleted:
- 5 hook files from .claude/hooks/
- 4 script files from .claude/scripts/  
- 4 library files from .claude/lib/
- 1 statusline.sh shell script

All functionality preserved in src/ directory. The auto-branching meant we could do this safely without worrying about breaking anything. If we needed to roll back, the branch could just be abandoned.
