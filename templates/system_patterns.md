# System Patterns

**Purpose:** Records established technical patterns, architectural decisions, coding standards, and recurring workflows. Ensures consistency and maintainability.

**Instructions:**
- Document significant, recurring patterns and standards
- Explain rationale behind chosen patterns
- Update when new patterns adopted or existing modified
- Append updates with: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - [Description of Pattern/Change]`

## Architectural Patterns

*(High-level structural patterns, e.g., Microservices, Monolith, Layered Architecture, Event-Driven)*

## Design Patterns

*(Common design patterns used in codebase, e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy)*

## Coding Standards & Conventions

*(Key coding style guides, naming conventions, linting rules)*

### Naming Conventions
- Functions: 
- Variables: 
- Classes: 
- Files: 

### Code Style
- Indentation: 
- Line length: 
- Comments: 

### Git Conventions
- Branch naming: 
- Commit messages: 
- PR process: 

## Testing Patterns

*(Testing approach, coverage requirements, test structure)*

- Test framework: 
- Coverage target: 
- Test organization: 
- Mocking strategy: 

## Workflow Patterns

*(Standard processes for development, testing, deployment)*

### Development Workflow
1. 
2. 
3. 

### Review Process
1. 
2.

## Tool Preferences

*(Specific tools and why they're preferred)*

- **Database access:** (e.g., MCP vs CLI)
- **File operations:** (e.g., Read vs cat)
- **Search:** (e.g., Grep vs find)
- **Package management:** (e.g., npm vs yarn)
