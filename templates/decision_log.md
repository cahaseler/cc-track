**Instructions:**
- Log decisions with notable impact on project direction, architecture, or implementation
- Include *why* the decision was made and alternatives considered
- Do **NOT** modify existing entries - append chronologically
- Format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - [Summary of Decision]` followed by details
