**Purpose:** This document captures the current state of the project, including the immediate focus, recent activities, open questions, and potential blockers. It provides a snapshot of "what's happening now."

**Instructions:**
*   Keep this document focused on the *current* working context.
*   Update frequently, especially at the start/end of work sessions or when the focus shifts.
*   Use timestamps for entries: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - [Summary]`
*   Orchestrator will append updates to the relevant sections.
