# Decision Log

**Purpose:** This document serves as an immutable record of significant decisions made throughout the project lifecycle. It captures the context, rationale, and implications of key choices.

**Instructions:**
*   Log decisions that have a notable impact on the project's direction, architecture, or implementation.
*   Include *why* the decision was made and what alternatives were considered (if any).
*   Do **not** modify existing entries. Append new decisions chronologically.
*   Use the format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - [Summary of Decision]` followed by details.
