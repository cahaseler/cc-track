# System Patterns

**Purpose:** This document records established technical patterns, architectural decisions, coding standards, and recurring workflows used within the project. It helps ensure consistency and maintainability.

**Instructions:**
*   Document significant, recurring patterns and standards.
*   Explain the rationale behind chosen patterns.
*   Update when new patterns are adopted or existing ones are modified.
*   Append updates with a timestamp and description: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - [Description of Pattern/Change]`
