> This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
  Analysis:
  The conversation is focused on migrating the CVAS (Colville Valley Animal Sanctuary) website, specifically working on the impact page and volunteer page. The user has been very particular about maintaining
   exact fidelity to the original site content while separating concerns (content in markdown, styling in templates).

  The impact page work involved extensive troubleshooting of misplaced and mislabeled images, implementing carousels, and adjusting layouts to match the original. The user was frequently frustrated when I
  made assumptions rather than checking the actual source, repeatedly telling me to "DO NOT GUESS" and "JUST LOOK AT THE ORIGINAL PAGE."

  Major issues encountered:
  1. Images were completely mislabeled when initially downloaded (fire-kitten images were actually dogs/cats, volunteer images were fire kittens, charts were building photos)
  2. Carousel implementation was initially poor, cutting off images
  3. Content was being changed instead of preserved exactly
  4. Section spacing issues

  The volunteer page was just started and involved creating a page with a collage image, content, button link (replacing iframe), and carousel.

  Key patterns in user feedback:
  - Strong emphasis on looking at actual HTML source, not making assumptions
  - Frustration when content words were changed
  - Insistence on markdown for content, templates for styling
  - Attention to visual details and spacing

  Summary:
  1. Primary Request and Intent:
     - Complete the CVAS website migration with exact fidelity to the original site
     - Fix all image placement issues on the impact page where photos were appearing in wrong sections
     - Rename confusingly named image files to be sensible
     - Implement proper carousel for fire kittens section that doesn't cut off images
     - Match original two-column layouts for various sections (Adoptions, Volunteers, Moving Forward)
     - Download all missing images from original site
     - Reduce spacing between sections
     - Create volunteer page with: collage image at top, header and content, button link (replacing iframe form), and carousel of images
     - Ensure content is in markdown and styling is in templates

  2. Key Technical Concepts:
     - Eleventy static site generator with Nunjucks templating
     - CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
     - JavaScript carousel implementation with viewport container
     - Markdown content with minimal HTML wrapper divs
     - Image downloading with curl/wget
     - Git version control for deployment
     - Netlify automatic deployment

  3. Files and Code Sections:
     - `/home/ubuntu/projects/cvasanctuary/src/content/pages/impact.md`
        - Main impact page content in markdown
        - Fixed to match original text exactly after user said "you edited the page content! DO NOT CHANGE THE WORDS FROM THE ORIGINAL!"
        - Added wrapper divs for two-column layouts
        ```markdown
        <div class="moving-forward-content">
        <div class="moving-forward-text">
        • **Adopt:** all pets come altered, up to date on shots, de-wormed, microchipped.
        </div>
        <div class="moving-forward-image">
        ![Abby](/assets/images/impact/moving-forward-abby.jpg)
        </div>
        </div>
        ```

     - `/home/ubuntu/projects/cvasanctuary/src/_includes/layouts/impact.njk`
        - Impact page template with all CSS and JavaScript
        - Fixed carousel after user said "I dont think you actually know how to implement a carousel properly"
        - Most recent edits: Reduced section margins from 4rem → 2rem → 1rem, set h2 margin-top to 0
        ```css
        .impact-section {
          margin-bottom: 1rem;
          background: transparent !important;
        }
        .impact-section h2 {
          margin-top: 0;
        }
        ```

     - `/home/ubuntu/projects/cvasanctuary/src/content/pages/volunteers.md`
        - New volunteer page content created
        - Set permalink to `/volunteer-with-us/` to match original site
        ```markdown
        ---
        title: "Volunteer with Us!"
        permalink: /volunteer-with-us/
        layout: layouts/volunteer.njk
        ---
        ```

     - `/home/ubuntu/projects/cvasanctuary/src/_includes/layouts/volunteer.njk`
        - New volunteer page template with carousel
        - Includes styling for collage image, button link, and carousel
        ```javascript
        function showSlide(index) {
          if (container && slides.length > 0) {
            currentSlide = (index + slides.length) % slides.length;
            container.style.transform = `translateX(-${currentSlide * 100}%)`;
          }
        }
        ```

     - Renamed image files in `src/assets/images/impact/`:
        - `fire-kitten-1.png` → `animal-breakdown-dog.png`
        - `fire-kitten-2.png` → `animal-breakdown-cats.png`
        - `volunteer-1.png` → `fire-kittens-recovered.png`
        - `volunteer-2.png` → `fire-kittens-treatment.png`
        - `volunteer-3.png` → `fire-kittens-after-1.png`
        - `volunteer-4.png` → `fire-kittens-after-2.png`
        - `small-stat-1.png` → `cat-statistics-chart.png`
        - `small-stat-2.png` → `dog-statistics-chart.png`

  4. Errors and fixes:
     - **Mislabeled images**: Fire-kitten PNGs were actually dog/cat photos, volunteer PNGs were fire kitten photos
        - Fixed by systematically viewing each image and renaming appropriately
        - User: "okay. Please systematically view every single photo on this page and rename it to something sensible"

     - **Carousel cutting off images**:
        - User: "the fire kitten carousel has significant formatting issues"
        - User: "I dont think you actually know how to implement a carousel properly. Rather than just guessing, research it properly"
        - Fixed by implementing proper viewport container and natural aspect ratio display

     - **Not checking original HTML**:
        - User: "NO! Fetch passes it through an LLM that edits what you see. Download the ACTUAL HTML and READ IT"
        - User: "JUST LOOK AT THE ORIGINAL PAGE!! DO NOT GUESS!"
        - Fixed by always downloading and checking actual HTML files

     - **Changing content words**:
        - User: "you edited the page content! DO NOT CHANGE THE WORDS FROM THE ORIGINAL!"
        - Fixed by restoring exact original text

     - **Duplicate building images**:
        - User told me at least 3 times to remove duplicate building photos under Animal Breakdown
        - Fixed by identifying misnamed files and removing duplicates

     - **Volunteer page showing "coming soon"**:
        - Old `volunteer.md` file was conflicting with new `volunteers.md`
        - Fixed by deleting old file and updating permalink to `/volunteer-with-us/`

  5. Problem Solving:
     - Successfully identified that downloaded images had completely wrong names by viewing each one
     - Fixed carousel to show images at natural aspect ratio without cutting off
     - Restructured multiple sections to match original two-column layouts
     - Downloaded missing images (volunteer kitten, Abby)
     - Consolidated duplicate sections (Volunteer Hours moved into Volunteers section)
     - Resolved conflicting volunteer page files

  6. All user messages:
     - "Still has issues. The photos of the buildings are both at the top under the history section (correct) and repeated under the Animal Breakdown header (wrong)..."
     - "you have all the images you need! Now just get rid of the duplicate building photos undet the animal breakdown section."
     - "right under the Animal breakdown header are the incorrectly labeled images that say they are fire kittens (but are not)..."
     - "there are two chart pngs after the buildings, those are correct. do you not see the extra building photos in the markdown or the template?"
     - "many of the images are missing or in the wrong places"
     - "DO NOT COMMIT UNTIL ITS FINISHED AND CONFIRMED WORKING"
     - "You still havent deleted the extra building images under animal breakdown like I have told you at least 3 times"
     - "no, the images you have in the slider look like rescued kittens. I guess the images are named terribly..."
     - "okay. Please systematically view every single photo on this page and rename it to something sensible..."
     - "the fire kitten carousel has significant formatting issues..."
     - "that didnt seem to change anything, if anything it seems to have made things worse."
     - "it still has the exact same issues. I dont think you actually know how to implement a carousel properly..."
     - "just look for instructions on creating a working carousel, googling the exact obscure issues with your shitty implementation isnt helpful"
     - "It's 2025, dont search outdated stuff"
     - "much better. The last section on the page, the Moving Forward block is completely different from the original site..."
     - "what about the content??"
     - "needs the image too"
     - "That image is already in the section above. I asked you to add the image IN the moving forward section..."
     - "you know our content needs to be in markdown and formatting and alignment needs to be handled in the template"
     - "two column layout not working on desktop"
     - "In the first History section, with the building photos, put the photos on two rows..."
     - "On the original site, the adoptions + animal breakdown section with the dog, cats, and two charts is aligned as two columns..."
     - "The volunteers section should have the volunteer charts directly below it, side by side..."
     - "Same deal with the Programs text and the two bar charts that are currently in the next section"
     - "Looks great. Only other thing I can see is that the gap between each section is too wide, maybe about half as much space"
     - "still too big of a gap between sections"
     - "theres a big gap before the first section after the page header"
     - "that didnt seem to change anything. dont assume that it's the margins, evaluate carefully and think"
     - "great. lets commit and deploy"
     - "On to the volunteer page. It starts with a grid of photos (single collage image), then has the header and content paragraph, then an iframe form (we will replace this with a button link), and finally
   a carousel of images."
     - "use www i think"
     - "oh looks like you have it"
     - "the page still just has the coming soon message"

  7. Pending Tasks:
     - None explicitly pending - impact page was committed and deployed, volunteer page is created and working

  8. Current Work:
     Just completed creating the volunteer page at `/volunteer-with-us/` with:
     - Photo collage at top (`photo-collage.png`)
     - "Volunteer with Us!" heading and content
     - Button link for volunteer application (replacing iframe)
     - Carousel with 5 volunteer images
     - Removed old conflicting `volunteer.md` file that had "coming soon" message
     - Fixed permalink to use `/volunteer-with-us/` to match original site

  9. Optional Next Step:
     The volunteer page appears to be complete and working. The user's last message "the page still just has the coming soon message" was addressed by removing the conflicting old volunteer.md file and
  updating the permalink. The page is now functioning at `/volunteer-with-us/`. Should await confirmation that the volunteer page is displaying correctly before proceeding with any other pages or committing
