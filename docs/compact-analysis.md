# Compact Summary Analysis

## What Gets Preserved

### High-Level Context
- **Primary request/intent** - Main goals of the session
- **User feedback patterns** - Behavioral preferences and frustrations
- **Current work status** - What was just completed
- **Pending tasks** - What's left to do

### Technical Overview
- **Key technical concepts** - Technologies used (Eleventy, Nunjucks, etc.)
- **Problem solving approaches** - How issues were resolved
- **Errors and fixes** - Major issues encountered

### File References
- **File paths** - Full paths to modified files
- **Code snippets** - Small examples of important changes
- **File renames** - Tracking of renamed/moved files

### User Messages
- **All user messages** - Complete history of user inputs (valuable!)

## What Gets Lost

### Critical Details
1. **Exact function/variable names** - Only shown in snippets
2. **Complete file contents** - Only fragments preserved
3. **Directory structure** - Not fully captured
4. **Import statements** - Lost unless in snippets
5. **Configuration details** - Only mentioned if critical
6. **Database schemas** - Would be summarized, not preserved
7. **API endpoints** - Only if explicitly mentioned
8. **Environment variables** - Lost unless problematic
9. **Package dependencies** - Not preserved
10. **Git branch/status** - Not captured

### Context Relationships
1. **Why certain decisions were made** - Unless explicitly discussed
2. **Alternative approaches considered** - Lost
3. **Dependencies between files** - Not captured
4. **Test coverage** - Not mentioned
5. **Performance considerations** - Lost unless discussed

### Working Knowledge
1. **Command outputs** - Not preserved
2. **Tool preferences** (MCP vs psql) - Might be lost
3. **Project conventions** - Only if violated
4. **Available utilities** - Not listed
5. **Project structure understanding** - Implicit, not explicit

## Patterns Observed

### Summary Structure
1. **Analysis section** - User behavior and preferences
2. **Summary section** with numbered categories:
   - Primary Request and Intent
   - Key Technical Concepts
   - Files and Code Sections (with snippets)
   - Errors and fixes
   - Problem Solving
   - All user messages (complete)
   - Pending Tasks
   - Current Work
   - Optional Next Step
3. **File reads at bottom** - Recent file accesses

### Quality Issues
1. **Verbose but not precise** - Long descriptions without key details
2. **Focus on problems** - More space on errors than solutions
3. **Code snippets arbitrary** - Not always the most important parts
4. **No systematic extraction** - Ad-hoc summarization

## Implications for cc-pars

### What We Need to Preserve
1. **Project metadata**:
   - Database type and connection details
   - API endpoints and authentication methods
   - Environment variables and configuration
   - Package dependencies and versions

2. **Codebase index**:
   - Directory structure map
   - File purposes and relationships
   - Key functions/classes per file
   - Import dependencies graph

3. **Working context**:
   - Current git branch and status
   - Recent commands and outputs
   - Test results and coverage
   - Performance metrics

4. **Conventions and patterns**:
   - Code style guidelines
   - Naming conventions
   - Architecture decisions
   - Tool preferences

### Extraction Strategy
1. **PreCompact hook** triggers our extraction
2. Parse transcript JSON for:
   - File reads/writes
   - Command executions
   - Error messages
   - Tool uses
3. Build structured index:
   - Extract function/class definitions
   - Map file relationships
   - Capture configuration
4. Write to persistent files imported by CLAUDE.md

### Storage Format
```markdown
# Project Context Index
