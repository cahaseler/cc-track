# Fix pushCurrentBranch to Handle Diverged Branches Automatically

**Purpose:** Update the `pushCurrentBranch` function to automatically handle diverged branches by fetching, rebasing, and pushing, while gracefully failing when conflicts occur.

**Status:** completed
**Started:** 2025-09-15 21:46
**Task ID:** 052

## Requirements
- [ ] Add fetch before push to detect branch divergence
- [ ] Check if local branch is behind remote using git status
- [ ] Implement automatic `git pull --rebase` when branches have diverged
- [ ] Handle successful rebase scenario and continue with push
- [ ] Handle rebase conflicts by aborting and returning clear error message
- [ ] Add appropriate logging for each step in the process
- [ ] Update tests for successful rebase and push scenario
- [ ] Add test for rebase with conflicts (should abort and fail gracefully)
- [ ] Add test for already up-to-date scenario
- [ ] Test logging messages for clarity
- [ ] Ensure standalone function wrapper continues to work unchanged

## Success Criteria
- `pushCurrentBranch` automatically handles semantic-release style diverged branches
- Function fails gracefully with clear error messages when conflicts occur
- All existing functionality is preserved
- Comprehensive test coverage for new scenarios
- Clear logging throughout the process

## Technical Approach
Implement a new flow in `pushCurrentBranch`:
1. `git fetch origin` to get latest remote state
2. Check if branches diverged using `git status -sb`
3. If diverged: attempt `git pull --rebase origin <current-branch>`
4. If rebase succeeds: continue to `git push -u origin HEAD`
5. If rebase fails: `git rebase --abort` and fail with message

## Current Focus

Task completed on 2025-09-15

## Open Questions & Blockers
- Need to verify current git command execution patterns in the codebase
- Ensure error handling is consistent with existing patterns
- Confirm test setup can simulate diverged branch scenarios

## Next Steps
1. Examine existing `pushCurrentBranch` implementation
2. Review current git command execution patterns in the codebase
3. Implement fetch and divergence detection logic
4. Add rebase handling with proper error management
5. Update tests to cover new scenarios
