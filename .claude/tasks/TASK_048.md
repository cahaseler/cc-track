# NPM Global Package Installation System for cc-track

**Purpose:** Implement a comprehensive NPM global installation system that publishes cc-track as a package with Bun-compiled binary, enabling users to install globally and use Claude-driven setup for intelligent project configuration.

**Status:** in_progress
**Started:** 2025-09-14 08:38
**Task ID:** 048

## Requirements
- [x] Update package.json with "bin" field pointing to ./dist/cc-track
- [x] Add "files" field to package.json including dist/
- [x] Add npm metadata (description, keywords, repository, author, license)
- [x] Create init command (src/commands/init.ts) that generates setup slash command
- [x] Create setup-templates command to copy templates from package location
- [x] Create setup-commands command to copy command files to project
- [x] Bundle templates and commands directories with npm package
- [x] Configure binary to read resources from embedded strings
- [x] Create .npmignore to exclude development files
- [x] Add prepublishOnly script to ensure build before publish
- [x] Design setup-cc-track.md slash command content for Claude instructions
- [x] Implement Claude-driven project analysis and configuration
- [x] Handle backup creation for existing files during setup
- [x] Exclude setup-cc-track.md from recursive copying
- [x] Configure semantic-release version synchronization

## Success Criteria
- [x] Users can install with `npx cc-track init` (even better than global!)
- [x] `cc-track init` creates proper setup slash command
- [x] Claude can run `/setup-cc-track` and complete full configuration
- [x] All templates and commands are properly copied to project
- [x] Project-specific configuration is intelligently generated
- [x] Installation works across different project types and structures
- [x] Binary correctly locates bundled resources via embedded strings

## Technical Approach
- Publish Bun-compiled binary via npm with bundled resources
- Use import.meta.dir for resource location in global installs
- Claude-driven setup provides intelligent project analysis
- Two-phase installation: npm global install + Claude setup
- Resource bundling preserves npm package directory structure

## Recent Progress
- Successfully implemented npm package distribution system for cc-track
- Created embed-resources.ts script to bundle templates and commands at build time
- Implemented init, setup-templates, and setup-commands CLI commands
- Fixed model identifier issues (updated to claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
- Added private journal MCP as configurable feature with conditional references
- Fixed hook configuration structure in setup instructions
- Added recommendation for converting pre-commit to pre-push hooks
- Configured semantic-release for automated npm publishing
- Published initial dev versions (1.0.0-dev.1 and 1.0.0-dev.2) to npm for testing
- Discovered npx works without requiring global installation
- Resolved all TypeScript and linting issues
- Researched npm packaging approaches for bundling templates and commands with binary
- Defined installation workflow: `npm install -g cc-track` → `cc-track init` → Claude-driven setup
- Clarified that slash commands cannot embed data and bunx/npx work fine with binary executables
- Planned Claude-driven setup approach for transparent user configuration

## Current Focus
Task complete - npm package distribution system fully implemented and tested

## Open Questions & Blockers
None - all implementation questions resolved during development

## Resolution Notes
- Build-time embedding eliminated runtime path resolution complexity
- npx usage proved superior to global installation requirement
- Semantic-release configured and ready for automated publishing
