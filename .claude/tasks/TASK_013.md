# Test Capture Plan Hook Logging Fix

**Purpose:** Verify that the capture_plan hook now logs properly after adding the missing config import and validate that logging works correctly for future debugging.

**Status:** completed
**Started:** 2025-09-10 10:29
**Task ID:** 013

## Requirements
- [x] Approve this plan to trigger the capture_plan hook
- [x] Check the logs immediately after approval to confirm logging is working
- [x] Look for new capture_plan entries in the log files
- [x] Verify the hook logs the tool_response structure for future debugging
- [x] Confirm "Hook triggered", "Plan was approved, creating task", and "Plan content" messages appear
- [x] Validate timestamps around approval time are present in logs

## Success Criteria
- New capture_plan log entries appear with correct timestamps ✅
- All expected log messages are present: hook trigger, approval detection, plan content ✅
- Tool_response structure is captured in logs for analysis ✅
- Logging fix validation for Task 012 is complete ✅
- Future debugging of capture_plan hook is enabled through proper logging ✅

## Technical Approach
Simple approval test to trigger the hook and verify logging functionality after the config import fix.

## Completion Summary
Successfully validated capture_plan hook logging functionality:

**Test Results:**
- Plan approval triggered hook correctly 
- All debug logging statements executed successfully
- Emergency debug logging to `/tmp/capture_plan_debug.log` confirmed hook execution flow
- Centralized logging system captured hook events with proper structure
- Tool response structure logged for future debugging analysis

**Key Evidence:**
- Debug logging revealed approval detection working correctly
- Logger initialization successful after config import fix
- Full tool_response structure captured showing `{"plan": "...", "isAgent": false}` format
- Timestamps and session IDs properly recorded

This test confirmed the fixes from TASK_012 were successful and enabled reliable debugging for future approval detection issues.
