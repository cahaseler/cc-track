**Purpose:** Verify that the capture_plan hook now logs properly after adding the missing config import and validate that logging works correctly for future debugging.

**Status:** planning
**Started:** 2025-09-10 10:29
**Task ID:** 013

## Requirements
- [ ] Approve this plan to trigger the capture_plan hook
- [ ] Check the logs immediately after approval to confirm logging is working
- [ ] Look for new capture_plan entries in the log files
- [ ] Verify the hook logs the tool_response structure for future debugging
- [ ] Confirm "Hook triggered", "Plan was approved, creating task", and "Plan content" messages appear
- [ ] Validate timestamps around approval time are present in logs

## Success Criteria
- New capture_plan log entries appear with correct timestamps
- All expected log messages are present: hook trigger, approval detection, plan content
- Tool_response structure is captured in logs for analysis
- Logging fix validation for Task 012 is complete
- Future debugging of capture_plan hook is enabled through proper logging

## Technical Approach
Simple approval test to trigger the hook and verify logging functionality after the config import fix.

## Current Focus
