# TASK_079: Test Quality Improvements

## Purpose
Standardize mock patterns, split oversized test files, and add integration tests to improve maintainability and coverage of the existing 366-test suite while preserving all functionality.

## Status
**in_progress** - Started: 2025-09-18 11:35

## Requirements
- [ ] Extend `src/test-utils/command-mocks.ts` with standardized mock factories
- [ ] Add `createMockClaudeSDK()`, `createMockGitHelpers()`, `createMockGitHubHelpers()` functions
- [ ] Migrate 25+ test files to use centralized mocks
- [ ] Remove duplicate mock creation code (~200-300 lines reduction)
- [ ] Split `complete-task.test.ts` (377 lines) into validation, git-flow, and github test files
- [ ] Split `stop-review.test.ts` (1,346 lines) into validation, commit, and claude-integration test files
- [ ] Create `src/integration/` directory for end-to-end workflow tests
- [ ] Add integration tests for complete task workflow, git branching, hook integration, and CLI commands
- [ ] Ensure all 366 existing tests continue passing throughout migration

## Success Criteria
- All existing tests remain passing (366 tests)
- Centralized mock patterns eliminate code duplication
- Large test files split by logical concern areas
- Integration tests cover critical end-to-end workflows
- Improved maintainability and development speed through standardized patterns

## Technical Approach
**Phase 1: Mock Standardization (High Priority)**
- Analyze existing mock patterns in `git-helpers.test.ts` and other files
- Extend `src/test-utils/command-mocks.ts` with factory functions
- Gradually migrate test files to use centralized mocks

**Phase 2: File Splitting (High Priority)**
- Split `complete-task.test.ts` into focused concern areas
- Break down `stop-review.test.ts` by logical functionality
- Maintain same test names and logic, reorganize structure only

**Phase 3: Integration Testing (Medium Priority)**
- Create integration test directory structure
- Build end-to-end tests for critical user workflows
- Focus on multi-component interactions and command chaining

## Current Focus
Beginning with Phase 1 mock standardization to establish foundation for subsequent improvements.

## Next Steps
1. Examine current mock patterns in test files to identify standardization opportunities
2. Extend `src/test-utils/command-mocks.ts` with commonly needed mock factories
3. Create migration plan for converting existing tests to use centralized mocks
4. Begin incremental migration of test files starting with highest-duplication areas
