# PostToolUse Hook for Edit Validation

**Purpose:** Create a PostToolUse hook that automatically runs TypeScript and Biome checks on files after they're edited via Edit, Write, or MultiEdit tools, providing immediate feedback to Claude on any errors found.

**Status:** completed
**Started:** 2025-09-10 15:11
**Task ID:** 020

## Requirements

- [x] Create `.claude/hooks/edit_validation.ts` hook implementation
- [x] Update `.claude/lib/config.ts` with type definitions for new config structure
- [x] Update `.claude/cc-pars.config.json` with edit_validation configuration section
- [x] Update `.claude/settings.json` to register PostToolUse hook for Edit|Write|MultiEdit
- [x] Update `.claude/commands/config-cc-pars.md` with documentation for new config options
- [x] Hook triggers only on PostToolUse for Edit, Write, and MultiEdit tools
- [x] Extract file path from tool_input for all three tool types
- [x] Skip non-TypeScript files (.ts/.tsx extension check)
- [x] Run configurable TypeScript (`bunx tsc --noEmit`) and Biome (`bunx biome check`) checks
- [x] Run checks in parallel for optimal performance
- [x] Format errors concisely for Claude's context using hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext
- [x] Return silently (continue: true) when no errors found
- [x] Make hook highly configurable (enable/disable entire hook, individual tools, custom commands)
- [x] Default to disabled for opt-in behavior
- [x] Include 5-second timeout for hook execution

## Success Criteria

- [x] Hook successfully detects and reports TypeScript errors after file edits
- [x] Hook successfully detects and reports Biome issues after file edits
- [x] Hook performs within acceptable time limits (<2 seconds total)
- [x] Hook can be enabled/disabled via configuration
- [x] Individual TypeScript and Biome checks can be toggled independently
- [x] Hook works correctly with all three edit tool types (Edit, Write, MultiEdit)
- [x] Non-TypeScript files are properly skipped
- [x] Error messages are formatted clearly for Claude's understanding
- [x] Configuration is properly documented
- [x] Hook fails gracefully when tools are not available

## Technical Approach

Implemented a PostToolUse hook that:
1. Checks if edit_validation is enabled in cc-pars config
2. Parses tool_input to extract file paths from Edit/Write/MultiEdit operations
3. Validates file extensions to only process TypeScript files
4. Runs TypeScript and Biome checks in parallel for speed
5. Formats any errors found and returns them via hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext
6. Returns continue: true to allow normal operation flow

Performance achieved based on testing:
- TypeScript check: ~1.3-1.4 seconds
- Biome check: ~60-160ms
- Total execution: <2 seconds

## Completion Summary

Successfully delivered a fully functional PostToolUse hook for edit validation that provides immediate feedback on TypeScript and linting errors after file edits.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Created `.claude/hooks/edit_validation.ts` with robust error handling and formatting
- Extended configuration system to support nested hook configuration (typecheck/lint sub-configs)
- Integrated with existing cc-pars configuration management
- Added comprehensive documentation to config-cc-pars command
- Thoroughly tested with various file types and error scenarios

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Used hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext for non-blocking error feedback
- Parallel execution of TypeScript and Biome checks for optimal performance
- Smart file filtering to only validate TypeScript files
- Graceful error handling to prevent hook failures from disrupting workflow
- Fully configurable commands allow users to customize for their toolchain

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Correctly identified TypeScript type errors
- ✅ Correctly identified Biome lint issues
- ✅ No false positives on clean files
- ✅ Properly skipped non-TypeScript files
- ✅ Performance consistently under 2 seconds

The feature is production-ready and can be enabled via `/config-cc-pars enable edit validation`.
