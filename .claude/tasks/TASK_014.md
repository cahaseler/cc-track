# Test Debug Logging in Capture Plan Hook

**Purpose:** Test the debug logging added to capture_plan hook to diagnose why centralized logging fails and identify the root cause of logger failure.

**Status:** completed
**Started:** 2025-09-10 10:35
**Task ID:** 014

## Requirements
- [x] Approve this plan to trigger the capture_plan hook with debug logging
- [x] Check debug output for detailed execution trace
- [x] Check centralized logs to see if logging now works
- [x] Analyze debug output to identify the root cause of logger failure
- [x] Verify debug log shows hook initialization and logger creation
- [x] Verify debug log shows input parsing and approval detection
- [x] Verify debug log shows each logger method call attempt
- [x] Verify debug log shows any errors or failures in the logging process

## Success Criteria
- Debug logging reveals detailed execution trace of capture_plan hook ✅
- Root cause of centralized logging failure is identified ✅
- Clear understanding of why capture_plan hook works functionally but fails to log centrally ✅
- Sufficient information gathered to fix the logging issue ✅

## Technical Approach
Simple approval test to trigger the hook with enhanced debug logging and analyze the output for diagnostic information.

## Completion Summary
Successfully diagnosed the capture_plan hook logging issue through comprehensive debug logging:

**Root Cause Discovered:**
- Missing config import prevented logger initialization
- Hook was checking wrong field (`success` instead of `plan`) for approval detection
- File path issues with duplicate hook files in different locations

**Debug Results:**
- Comprehensive debug logging to `/tmp/capture_plan_debug.log` revealed execution flow
- Logger creation attempts and failures tracked in detail
- Approval detection logic thoroughly instrumented
- Input parsing and response structure analysis captured

**Key Findings:**
- Hook execution successful but logger failed to initialize without config
- Response structure showed `{"plan": "...", "isAgent": false}` format
- Approval detection needed to check `tool_response?.plan` instead of `tool_response?.success`

**Resolution Path:**
Led directly to file consolidation effort and the comprehensive fix implemented across TASK_012 and validated in TASK_015.
