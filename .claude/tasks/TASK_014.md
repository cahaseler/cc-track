# Test Debug Logging in Capture Plan Hook

**Purpose:** Test the debug logging added to capture_plan hook to diagnose why centralized logging fails and identify the root cause of logger failure.

**Status:** planning
**Started:** 2025-09-10 10:35
**Task ID:** 014

## Requirements
- [ ] Approve this plan to trigger the capture_plan hook with debug logging
- [ ] Check debug output for detailed execution trace
- [ ] Check centralized logs to see if logging now works
- [ ] Analyze debug output to identify the root cause of logger failure
- [ ] Verify debug log shows hook initialization and logger creation
- [ ] Verify debug log shows input parsing and approval detection
- [ ] Verify debug log shows each logger method call attempt
- [ ] Verify debug log shows any errors or failures in the logging process

## Success Criteria
- Debug logging reveals detailed execution trace of capture_plan hook
- Root cause of centralized logging failure is identified
- Clear understanding of why capture_plan hook works functionally but fails to log centrally
- Sufficient information gathered to fix the logging issue

## Technical Approach
Simple approval test to trigger the hook with enhanced debug logging and analyze the output for diagnostic information.

## Current Focus
Execute the minimal test by approving this plan and immediately analyzing debug output.

## Open Questions & Blockers
None - straightforward diagnostic test.

## Next Steps
1. Approve this plan to trigger capture_plan hook with debug logging
2. Check debug output for detailed execution trace
3. Review centralized logs for any new entries
4. Analyze debug information to identify logger failure root cause
5. Document findings for logging system fix
