# Make Stop Review Hook More Lenient About Documentation Updates

**Purpose:** Modify the stop_review hook to filter out .md file changes from git diff before sending to Claude for review, preventing false deviation detections and saving tokens on documentation updates.

**Status:** completed
**Started:** 2025-09-10 17:07
**Task ID:** 022

## Requirements
- [x] Create `getFilteredGitDiff()` method that separates .md changes from code changes
- [x] Update `review()` method to use filtered diff for deviation detection
- [x] Auto-approve documentation-only changes without sending to Claude
- [x] Update `buildReviewPrompt()` to clarify that .md files are excluded
- [x] Generate appropriate commit messages for documentation-only changes (e.g., "docs: update progress log")
- [x] Preserve full diff for commit message generation when mixed changes exist
- [x] Handle mixed changes (code + docs) by reviewing only code portions
- [x] Add proper parsing logic to detect file boundaries in git diff output
- [x] Update backlog.md to remove the addressed deviation detection item

## Success Criteria
- Documentation-only changes auto-approve without Claude review
- Code changes still get proper review with filtered diff
- Mixed changes review only the code portions
- Commit messages are appropriate for documentation vs code changes
- Token usage reduced by excluding large markdown files from review
- No false positive deviation warnings for documentation updates

## Technical Approach
1. **Diff Filtering:** Parse git diff output to identify file boundaries and filter out .md files
2. **Smart Review Logic:** Use filtered diff for review but preserve full diff for commit messages
3. **Auto-approval:** Skip Claude review entirely for documentation-only changes
4. **Enhanced Prompting:** Update review prompt to clarify exclusion of documentation files

## Completion Summary

Successfully implemented intelligent documentation filtering in the stop_review hook to prevent false deviation detections and save tokens.

**What was delivered:**
- Created `getFilteredGitDiff()` method that parses git diff output and filters out documentation files
- Modified `review()` method to use filtered diff, with special handling for doc-only changes
- Updated `buildReviewPrompt()` to explicitly state that .md files are excluded and always acceptable
- Implemented auto-approval for documentation-only changes with appropriate commit messages
- Removed the addressed backlog item about deviation detection

**Key implementation details:**
- Diff parsing uses `diff --git` headers to identify file boundaries
- Filters .md, .markdown, .rst, .txt, README files, and anything in /docs/ directories
- Tracks both `hasDocChanges` and `hasCodeChanges` flags for intelligent behavior
- Documentation-only changes generate "docs:" prefixed commit messages
- Mixed changes send only code portions to Claude while preserving full diff for commits

**Testing results:**
- Verified filtering logic correctly separates doc and code changes
- Tested with sample diffs showing proper file boundary detection
- Confirmed significant reduction in diff size when docs are filtered

**No deviations from requirements** - all planned functionality was implemented as specified.

## Open Questions & Blockers
- Need to verify git diff format consistency across different change types
- Should test with various markdown file extensions (.md, .markdown, .rst, etc.)
- Need to handle edge cases like renamed .md files

## Next Steps
1. Read and analyze current `.claude/hooks/stop_review.ts` implementation
2. Implement `getFilteredGitDiff()` method with proper diff parsing
3. Update `review()` method to use filtered diff logic
4. Test with different change scenarios (code-only, docs-only, mixed)
5. Update prompts and commit message generation
