# Test Fixed Approval Detection

**Purpose:** Test that the capture_plan hook now correctly detects plan approval using the 'plan' field instead of the non-existent 'success' field.

**Status:** completed
**Started:** 2025-09-10 11:00
**Task ID:** 015

## Requirements
- [x] Verify the capture_plan hook detects plan approval correctly
- [x] Confirm the hook uses the 'plan' field instead of 'success' field  
- [x] Validate that Task 015 is created with proper logging
- [x] Test the complete approval workflow

## Success Criteria
- Plan is approved and creates Task 015 ✅
- Proper logging occurs during the approval process ✅
- Hook functions correctly with the updated field detection ✅
- No errors in the approval detection mechanism ✅

## Technical Approach
Execute a test plan that triggers the capture_plan hook to validate the fixed approval detection logic using the correct 'plan' field.

## Completion Summary
Successfully validated the capture_plan approval detection fix. The hook now correctly:
- Detects plan approval using `tool_response?.plan` instead of non-existent `success` field
- Creates Task 015 as evidenced by proper task file creation
- Logs the entire process to centralized logging system
- Functions without errors in the approval workflow

Evidence from logs (2025-09-10T15:00:45.684Z):
```
{"level":"INFO","source":"capture_plan","message":"Plan was approved, creating task"}
```

This test confirms the fix for the core approval detection issue that was breaking task creation across the entire cc-pars system.
