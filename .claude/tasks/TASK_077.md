# TASK_077: Investigate /complete-task PR Creation Failure

## Purpose
Investigate the root cause of a /complete-task command failure that occurred when attempting to create a PR in another project, despite the same code working successfully in the current project.

## Status
- [x] in_progress

## Requirements
- [x] Review cc-track logs to identify the exact failure point during the failed /complete-task run
- [x] Examine GitHub helper logs around push operations
- [x] Check complete-task command logs for the sequence of operations
- [x] Compare with successful runs in this project to identify differences
- [x] Review logs from successful complete-task operations on new branches
- [x] Identify any environmental or configuration differences
- [x] Access the failing project if needed to compare git configuration
- [x] Check GitHub CLI setup and authentication in the failing project
- [x] Review the specific branch state when the failure occurred
- [x] Analyze the root cause based on actual data rather than assumptions
- [x] Determine if it's a git config issue, authentication problem, or logic bug
- [x] Understand why the same code works here but failed there

## Success Criteria
- Root cause of the /complete-task PR creation failure is identified
- Clear understanding of why the failure occurred in one project but not another
- Determination of whether a code fix is needed or if it's a configuration issue
- Actionable next steps for resolving the issue

## Technical Approach
1. **Evidence-based investigation** - examine actual logs rather than making assumptions
2. **Comparative analysis** - compare successful vs failed runs to identify differences
3. **Systematic debugging** - follow the failure sequence step by step
4. **Environmental analysis** - check for configuration differences between projects

## Current Focus

Task completed on 2025-09-17

## Next Steps
1. Access and review cc-track logs from the failed operation
2. Identify the specific failure point in the command sequence
3. Compare with successful runs to understand the difference
4. Determine if further investigation of the failing project environment is needed

## Recent Progress

- Investigated bug report from clauditor project about /complete-task PR creation failure
- Analyzed cc-track logs and found evidence of transient push failures (2025-09-15)
- Compared git configurations between working (cc-track) and failing (clauditor) projects
- Identified root cause as GitHub API timing issue (race condition between push and PR creation)
- Implemented 2-second delay after push to allow GitHub API propagation
- Added retry logic for PR creation with "must first push" error detection (2 attempts max)
- Tests pass, TypeScript compiles cleanly, binary builds successfully
- Code review completed and approved with minor observations for future improvements
