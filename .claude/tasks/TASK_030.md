# Hook Improvements for Better Developer Experience

**Purpose:** Improve edit-validation and stop-review hooks to provide cleaner developer experience by ensuring test files are silently skipped during TypeScript checking and private journal files are excluded from code review diffs while remaining in git for backup.

**Status:** completed
**Started:** 2025-09-12 22:34
**Completed:** 2025-09-12 22:49
**Task ID:** 030

## Requirements
- [x] Update stop-review hook to filter out `.private-journal/**` files from review diffs
- [x] Update stop-review hook to filter out files ending in `.embedding` from review diffs
- [x] Verify edit-validation hook silently skips test files without generating output
- [x] Add test cases to stop-review.test.ts for private journal file filtering
- [x] Add test cases to stop-review.test.ts for .embedding file filtering
- [x] Verify edit-validation.test.ts confirms silent skipping behavior
- [x] Fix false positive task warning when active task exists
- [x] Rebuild CLI binary with all changes

## Success Criteria
- Private journal files remain tracked in git but are excluded from stop-review processing
- No "deviation" flags for private journal changes during code reviews
- Test files generate no confusing TypeScript error output when skipped
- All existing tests pass
- New test cases verify the filtering behavior works correctly

## Technical Approach
- Modify `getFilteredGitDiff()` method in `src/hooks/stop-review.ts` around lines 280-286
- Add filtering patterns to existing filter logic alongside .md file exclusions
- Leverage existing test file skipping logic in edit-validation hook (lines 115-119)
- Ensure silent operation when files are filtered/skipped

## Recent Progress

**Session Summary:**
Successfully implemented all three requested improvements to enhance the developer experience:

1. **Private Journal Filtering**: Modified `getFilteredGitDiff()` in stop-review hook to exclude `.private-journal/` and `.embedding` files from code review while keeping them in git for backup.

2. **Edit Validation Refinement**: Verified that edit-validation hook already skips TypeScript checking for test files (lines 115-119). The issue was that the CLI binary hadn't been rebuilt after earlier changes.

3. **Task Warning Fix**: Fixed false positive "commits without an active task" warning by:
   - Making `getActiveTaskId()` method public (was private)
   - Modifying logic to only show warning when NO active task exists
   - Added comprehensive test coverage for this scenario

**Technical Highlights:**
- Used dependency injection pattern throughout for testability
- Avoided module mock contamination issue learned from TASK_029
- All 249 tests passing with proper mock isolation
- Successfully rebuilt CLI binary with all changes

## Key Implementation Details

### Stop-Review Hook Changes
Modified filtering logic to skip private journal and embedding files:
```typescript
skipCurrentFile =
  currentFile.endsWith('.md') ||
  currentFile.includes('.private-journal/') ||
  currentFile.endsWith('.embedding');
```

### Task Warning Logic Fix
Changed from checking if commits contain "TASK_" to checking for active task existence:
```typescript
const activeTaskId = reviewer.getActiveTaskId();
if (!activeTaskId && !review.commitMessage.includes('TASK_')) {
  // Only suggest task creation when NO active task exists
}
```

### Test Strategy
Created mock `claudeMdHelpers` object to avoid contamination issues:
```typescript
const mockClaudeMdHelpers = {
  getActiveTaskContent: mock(() => '# Task 030...'),
  getActiveTaskId: mock(() => 'TASK_030'),
  // ... other methods
};
```

## Outcome
All requested improvements have been successfully implemented and tested. The developer experience is now cleaner with:
- No false positives for private journal changes
- No confusing TypeScript errors for test files  
- No incorrect task warnings when actively working on a task
