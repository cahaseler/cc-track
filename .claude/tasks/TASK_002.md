# Pre-Compact Hook Implementation

**Purpose:** Create a context preservation system that extracts and saves critical project knowledge before Claude Code compaction

**Status:** completed
**Started:** 2025-09-09 17:23
**Task ID:** 002

## Requirements
- [x] Parse JSON input from stdin (messageId, threadId, conversationStats, transcript)
- [x] Process JSONL transcript to extract conversation history
- [x] Extract environment & configuration details (DB connections, APIs, env vars, dependencies)
- [x] Map codebase structure (directory tree, key files, imports, patterns)
- [x] Capture current state (git status, commands, test results, errors)
- [x] Document patterns & decisions (conventions, architecture, tool preferences)
- [x] Update persistent context files (code_index.md, system_patterns.md, decision_log.md, progress_log.md)
- [x] Implement 30-second timeout handling
- [x] Add graceful error handling to not block compaction
- [x] Return JSON response with success status

## Success Criteria
- Context survival rate after compaction increases significantly
- Key technical details (DB setup, API endpoints, dependencies) persist across sessions
- Project patterns and conventions remain accessible post-compaction
- Recent work progress and decisions are preserved
- Failed approaches and solutions are captured for future reference
- Hook executes within 30-second timeout
- Errors don't block compaction process

## Technical Approach
Build a TypeScript/Bun script that systematically extracts knowledge from conversation transcript using structured parsing. Focus on event-based extraction (file operations, commands, errors) rather than summarization. Update markdown context files by appending chronologically to preserve history.

## Recent Progress

Successfully pivoted from general context extraction to focused error pattern learning:
- Implemented JSONL transcript parsing with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Built error sequence extraction that identifies failures and recovery attempts
- Integrated Claude CLI for batch analysis of error patterns
- Created learned_mistakes.md system for persistent knowledge
- Added post-compaction hook for task documentation updates
- Tested with real transcript data and extracted meaningful patterns

Key learnings from implementation:
- Regex parsing was wrong approach - needed proper JSONL parsing
- Batch analysis more effective than individual sequence analysis
- Tool use data nested in message.content arrays, not direct fields
- Claude CLI requires temp file approach for complex prompts
- 5-hour billing blocks crucial for API limit management

## Current Focus
Hook completed and operational - extracting error patterns from sessions

## Resolved Questions
- ✅ JSONL format verified through real transcript testing
- ✅ Parsing strategy: streaming line-by-line with 20s timeout
- ✅ Error pattern extraction via sequence analysis
- ✅ Timeout handling with partial data processing

## Improvements Made
- Changed from general extraction to error-focused learning
- Improved prompting for Claude CLI analysis
- Added human-readable command formatting
- Integrated with CLAUDE.md via @imports
- Added post-compaction documentation updates
