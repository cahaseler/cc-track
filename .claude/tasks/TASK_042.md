# Create Git Diff Summary Utility Using Claude SDK

**Purpose:** Create a comprehensive utility function that uses the existing Claude SDK wrapper to summarize git diffs, following established patterns for dependency injection and testing.

**Status:** completed
**Started:** 2025-09-13 17:57
**Task ID:** 042

## Requirements
- [x] Create `src/lib/diff-summary.ts` with `DiffSummary` class and `DiffSummaryInterface`
- [x] Implement `summarizeDiff(diff: string)` method for single diff summarization
- [x] Implement `summarizeDiffs(diffs: string[])` method for multiple diffs
- [x] Use constructor injection pattern for ClaudeSDK and logger dependencies
- [x] Use haiku model for cost-efficient summarization
- [x] Add 15000ms timeout for API calls
- [x] Implement diff truncation for large diffs (>3000 chars)
- [x] Include proper error handling and logging
- [x] Create `src/lib/diff-summary.test.ts` with comprehensive unit tests
- [x] Test successful single and multiple diff summaries
- [x] Test error handling (SDK failures, timeouts)
- [x] Test empty/invalid input handling
- [x] Use dependency injection with mock ClaudeSDK and logger
- [x] Create `src/lib/diff-summary.integration.test.ts` with real SDK testing (completed then removed per user request)
- [x] Follow existing test patterns from git-helpers.test.ts

## Success Criteria
- DiffSummary class properly implements the interface with dependency injection
- All unit tests pass with mocked dependencies
- Integration test validates real SDK behavior
- Summaries are concise (<500 chars) and focus on user-visible changes
- Error handling gracefully manages SDK failures and timeouts
- Code follows established patterns from existing codebase

## Technical Approach
- Use optional dependency injection with defaults (following GitHelpers pattern)
- Lazy load ClaudeSDK if not provided (ensureClaudeSDK pattern)
- Implement structured prompt engineering for bullet-point summaries
- Focus on "what changed" rather than "how"
- Group related changes and ignore formatting/whitespace changes
- Truncate large diffs before API submission

## Current Focus

Task completed on 2025-09-13

## Open Questions & Blockers
None - all questions were resolved during implementation.

## Recent Progress
- ✅ Created `src/lib/diff-summary.ts` with DiffSummary class implementing full interface
- ✅ Implemented both `summarizeDiff()` and `summarizeDiffs()` methods with proper error handling
- ✅ Added constructor dependency injection for ClaudeSDK and Logger following established patterns
- ✅ Implemented lazy SDK loading with `ensureClaudeSDK()` pattern
- ✅ Added diff truncation at 3000 chars with boundary detection
- ✅ Created comprehensive unit tests in `src/lib/diff-summary.test.ts` (16 passing tests)
- ✅ Implemented integration tests that validate real SDK behavior
- ✅ Fixed prompt engineering to prevent AI from mentioning tools in summaries
- ✅ Applied all lint fixes and ensured TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Removed integration tests per user request (they were working but not needed in main test suite)
- ✅ All 269 unit tests pass, lint and typecheck pass

The utility successfully:
- Uses haiku model for cost efficiency
- Implements 15-second timeout for API calls
- Provides concise summaries focused on "what changed"
- Groups related changes and ignores formatting
- Handles empty diffs, errors, and edge cases gracefully
- Follows all existing dependency injection patterns from the codebase
