# Fix add-to-backlog Command and Restore Lost Items

**Purpose:** Fix the broken add-to-backlog command that's adding empty lines instead of content, and restore the 5 backlog items that were lost due to this bug.

**Status:** completed
**Started:** 2025-09-10 08:42
**Task ID:** 009

## Requirements
- [x] Manually add the 5 lost items to the backlog file
- [x] Clean up existing empty lines in backlog
- [x] Debug why the `$1` variable isn't being passed through in the bash command
- [x] Fix the add-to-backlog command to properly capture arguments
- [x] Test the fixed command with a sample item
- [x] Verify all 5 items are properly added to backlog

## Success Criteria
- Backlog file contains all 5 lost items with proper formatting
- No empty lines remain in backlog file
- add-to-backlog command successfully adds new items when tested
- Command captures full argument text, not just first word

## Technical Approach
Three potential solutions to investigate:
1. **Debug variable passing**: Test different variable names or escaping methods for `$1`
2. **Temp file approach**: Have command write to temp file instead of relying on bash arguments
3. **Dedicated script**: Create separate script that handles argument capture and backlog writing

## Current Focus
Start with manual recovery of lost items, then investigate the variable passing issue in the slash command.

## Open Questions & Blockers
- Is this a Claude Code specific issue with how command arguments are handled?
- Should we use positional arguments (`$@`) or environment variables instead of `$1`?
- Are there limitations on bash variable access within slash commands?

## Recent Progress
- Successfully debugged the argument passing issue - discovered `$ARGUMENTS` needed to be quoted
- Created TypeScript implementation to handle arguments properly and add date stamps
- Restored all 5 lost backlog items with proper formatting
- Tested the command with multiple items to confirm it works correctly
- Command now captures full argument text including spaces

## Solution Summary
The root cause was the unquoted `$ARGUMENTS` variable in the command file. Fixed by:
1. Adding quotes: `"$ARGUMENTS"` in the bash invocation
2. Using TypeScript script to handle argument processing and file operations
3. Added date stamps to track when items were added
