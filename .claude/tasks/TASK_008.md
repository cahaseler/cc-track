# Add Git Branch Support to cc-pars

**Purpose:** Add optional git branch support that creates feature branches for each task and merges them back on completion

**Status:** completed
**Started:** 2025-09-10 07:38
**Task ID:** 008

## Requirements
- [x] Add git_branching feature to configuration system
- [x] Create git-helpers.ts module with branch management utilities
- [x] Update capture_plan.ts to create branches for new tasks
- [x] Update complete-task command to merge branches back
- [x] Generate branch names using Claude CLI Haiku
- [x] Generate commit messages using Claude CLI Haiku
- [x] Keep branches after merge for reference (don't delete)
- [x] Default feature to disabled for backwards compatibility

## Success Criteria
- Git branching can be enabled/disabled via config
- When enabled, new tasks create feature branches automatically
- Uncommitted work is committed before branch creation
- Branch names are meaningful and include task ID
- Task completion merges branch back to main/master
- Branches are preserved for reference after merge
- Feature doesn't affect users who have it disabled

## Technical Approach
Create a git-helpers module with functions for branch operations. Use Claude CLI with Haiku model for generating branch names and commit messages (cost-effective for simple text). Hook into capture_plan for branch creation and complete-task for merging. Store branch name in task file as HTML comment for later reference.

## Current Focus
Task completed on 2025-09-10

## Completion Summary

### What Was Delivered
- **Git branching feature flag** added to configuration system (disabled by default)
- **Git helper module** (`.claude/lib/git-helpers.ts`) with comprehensive git operations
- **Automatic branch creation** in capture_plan hook when feature is enabled
- **Branch merging support** in complete-task command
- **AI-powered naming** using Claude Haiku for branch names and commit messages
- **CLAUDE.md reminder** to prevent premature task completion

### Key Implementation Details
- Branches are created in format `feature/description-task008` or `bug/description-task008`
- Uncommitted changes are auto-committed before branch creation
- Branches are kept after merge for reference (not deleted per user preference)
- Strong prompting technique ("CRITICAL: Return ONLY...") ensures Haiku returns clean output
- Claude CLI runs from `/tmp` to avoid triggering own hooks (recursion prevention)
- Branch name stored as HTML comment in task file for later reference

### Deviations from Original Requirements
- None - all requirements were met as planned

### Lessons Learned
- Haiku model is sufficient for simple text generation with proper prompting
- Running CLI commands from project directory can trigger own hooks (recursion issue)
- Placing reminders in files being edited is more effective than in system messages
- Using existing helper scripts (git-session.ts) is better than reimplementing functionality
