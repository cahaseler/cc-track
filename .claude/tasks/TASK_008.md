# Add Git Branch Support to cc-pars

**Purpose:** Add optional git branch support that creates feature branches for each task and merges them back on completion

**Status:** in_progress
**Started:** 2025-09-10 07:38
**Task ID:** 008

## Requirements
- [x] Add git_branching feature to configuration system
- [x] Create git-helpers.ts module with branch management utilities
- [x] Update capture_plan.ts to create branches for new tasks
- [x] Update complete-task command to merge branches back
- [x] Generate branch names using Claude CLI Haiku
- [x] Generate commit messages using Claude CLI Haiku
- [x] Keep branches after merge for reference (don't delete)
- [x] Default feature to disabled for backwards compatibility

## Success Criteria
- Git branching can be enabled/disabled via config
- When enabled, new tasks create feature branches automatically
- Uncommitted work is committed before branch creation
- Branch names are meaningful and include task ID
- Task completion merges branch back to main/master
- Branches are preserved for reference after merge
- Feature doesn't affect users who have it disabled

## Technical Approach
Create a git-helpers module with functions for branch operations. Use Claude CLI with Haiku model for generating branch names and commit messages (cost-effective for simple text). Hook into capture_plan for branch creation and complete-task for merging. Store branch name in task file as HTML comment for later reference.

## Current Focus
Testing and documentation complete. Ready for task completion.
