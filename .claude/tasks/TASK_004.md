# Fix code_index.md File Structure

**Purpose:** Clean up duplicate and useless entries in code_index.md that were leftover artifacts from TASK_002's pivoted implementation

**Status:** completed
**Started:** 2025-09-10 23:07
**Task ID:** 004

## Requirements
- [x] Remove all duplicate "Directory Structure" sections from lines 46-136 in code_index.md
- [x] Remove all duplicate "Key Files" sections from lines 46-136 in code_index.md
- [x] Keep only the clean structure already added (lines 1-71)
- [x] Verify no automation currently writes to code_index.md
- [x] Confirm pre_compact hook only updates learned_mistakes.md
- [x] Confirm post_compact hook only injects instructions without modifying files
- [x] Document that code_index.md is for manual updates during sessions
- [x] Document that code_index.md tracks significant structural changes, not every file modification

## Success Criteria
- code_index.md contains only the clean, manually-maintained structure
- No duplicate or auto-generated content remains
- File serves its intended purpose as a manual reference for project structure
- Documentation clearly states the file's manual update policy

## Technical Approach
Clean up the markdown file by removing leftover artifacts from TASK_002's original implementation that was later pivoted to focus only on error patterns. No code changes needed - purely a documentation cleanup task.

## Completion Summary
Successfully cleaned up code_index.md and verified the context management system:
- Removed duplicate artifact entries (file now 70 lines, clean structure)
- Confirmed no automation writes to code_index.md
- Verified pre_compact hook only updates learned_mistakes.md
- Verified post_compact hook only injects instructions without file modifications
- All context files verified clean and properly formatted

The duplicate entries were artifacts from TASK_002's original plan which was pivoted to focus only on error pattern extraction. The code_index.md is now properly maintained as a manual reference updated thoughtfully during sessions.
