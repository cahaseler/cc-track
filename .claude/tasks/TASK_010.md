# Improve Handling for Non-Task Associated Commits

**Purpose:** Generate meaningful commit messages for work not associated with tasks and suggest task creation after detecting patterns of non-task work.

**Status:** completed
**Started:** 2025-09-10 09:15
**Task ID:** 010

## Requirements
- [x] Generate meaningful commit messages using Haiku for non-task work
- [x] Track consecutive non-task commits ~~in `.claude/non_task_commits.json`~~ using git log directly
- [x] Suggest task creation after 3+ consecutive non-task commits
- [x] ~~Use "[exploratory]" prefix instead of "[wip]" for non-task commits~~ Use clean commit messages without fixed prefixes
- [x] ~~Reset tracking when a task is created or acknowledged~~ No tracking file needed

## Success Criteria
- Non-task commits have descriptive messages based on actual changes
- System tracks consecutive non-task commits accurately
- Gentle suggestion appears after 3+ non-task commits
- Suggestion is non-intrusive (informational only, not blocking)
- Tracking resets appropriately when tasks are created

## Technical Approach
1. **Enhance stop_review.ts**: 
   - Import generateCommitMessage from git-helpers
   - Call Haiku to generate messages when no task is active
   - Use "[exploratory]" prefix for clarity

2. **Add tracking mechanism**:
   - Create/update `.claude/non_task_commits.json`
   - Track count, last commit hash, and commit messages
   - Increment counter for each non-task commit

3. **Implement suggestion logic**:
   - Check count after each non-task commit
   - Display gentle reminder at 3+ commits
   - Include shift-tab instruction for planning mode

## Current Focus
Task completed on 2025-09-10

## Completion Summary
Successfully simplified and improved non-task commit handling by:
- Using git log directly instead of creating a tracker file (much simpler)
- Generating meaningful commit messages via Claude Haiku for all non-task work
- Adding gentle suggestions after 3+ consecutive non-task commits
- Correcting planning mode instruction to use shift-tab (not /plan)

### Key Implementation Details
- Modified `stop_review.ts` to call `generateCommitMessage` for non-task commits
- Added `checkRecentNonTaskCommits()` method that examines git history
- Removed unnecessary complexity - no tracker files or reset logic needed
- Clean commit messages without forced prefixes

### Deviations from Original Requirements
- Didn't create `.claude/non_task_commits.json` - used git log instead (better approach)
- Didn't use "[exploratory]" prefix - generates clean conventional commit messages
- No reset logic needed since we're not tracking in a file

### Lessons Learned
- Always check if existing tools (git log) can solve the problem before creating new state files
- Craig values simplicity - don't over-engineer solutions
- Planning mode is accessed via shift-tab, not slash commands
