# Integration Testing Plan for cc-track

**Purpose:** Add comprehensive integration tests to validate multi-component workflows and real-world scenarios that unit tests can't cover, focusing on high-value paths that users actually experience.

**Status:** completed
**Started:** 2025-09-18 13:32
**Task ID:** 080

## Recent Progress
- **Completed comprehensive codebase research** - Analyzed existing test structure revealing 366 unit tests with excellent DI patterns but zero integration tests
- **Identified key patterns for integration testing** - Found mature mock infrastructure in `src/test-utils/command-mocks.ts` (550 lines) that provides foundation for integration test infrastructure
- **Discovered hook testing patterns** - Located established dependency injection patterns in `src/hooks/capture-plan.test.ts:88-236` and command testing patterns in `src/commands/complete-task-workflow.test.ts:23-162`
- **Found temporary git repo patterns** - Identified working pattern in `scripts/bench-stop-review.ts:19-38` for creating real git repositories in tests
- **Documented specific integration test categories** - Defined 5 test categories with ~16 total tests focusing on high-value user workflows that unit tests can't cover
- **Created detailed technical approach** - Specified exact file patterns, infrastructure functions, and implementation details based on existing codebase patterns
- **Implemented comprehensive integration test infrastructure** - Created `src/test-utils/integration-helpers.ts` with temp git repo creation, project setup, hook execution, and sophisticated mocking
- **Implemented Task Lifecycle Integration Tests** - Created 5 comprehensive tests in `src/integration-tests/task-lifecycle.test.ts` covering plan capture through task completion workflows
- **Added CI/CD integration** - Updated GitHub Actions workflow to build binary before running integration tests
- **Completed code review and fixes** - Addressed command injection concerns for automated security checks compliance

## Requirements
- [x] Create integration test infrastructure supporting temporary git repositories and full project setup
- [x] Implement Task Lifecycle Integration Tests (~5 tests) covering plan capture through task completion
- [x] All tests must pass existing validation (TypeScript, Biome, existing unit tests remain at 100% pass rate)
- [x] Integration tests organized in dedicated directory structure with clear naming conventions
- [x] Test infrastructure provides clean setup/teardown and proper test isolation

Note: Additional test categories (Hook Chain, Git Operations, Context Management, Configuration Propagation) were moved to backlog for future implementation.

## Success Criteria
- Integration tests catch component interaction bugs that unit tests miss
- Tests validate actual user workflows end-to-end  
- Tests provide regression prevention for complex multi-step operations
- Test infrastructure is reusable and maintainable
- All tests run reliably in CI/CD environment
- Tests serve as executable documentation of system behavior

## Technical Approach

Based on codebase research, the implementation will follow established patterns:

### Test Infrastructure (`src/test-utils/integration-helpers.ts`)
Build on existing `src/test-utils/command-mocks.ts` patterns:
- Extend `createExtendedTestDeps()` for integration scenarios
- Use temporary directory pattern from `scripts/bench-stop-review.ts:19-38`
- Leverage existing `MockFileSystem`, `MockConsole`, `MockExecFunction` abstractions
- Add git repository initialization following `scripts/bench-stop-review.ts:33-37`

### Test Organization Structure
```
src/integration-tests/
├── task-lifecycle.test.ts      # Full task workflows  
├── hook-chains.test.ts         # Multi-hook interactions
├── git-operations.test.ts      # Real git operations
├── context-management.test.ts  # Context file handling
└── config-propagation.test.ts  # Configuration effects
```

Following the pattern established in existing test files like `src/hooks/capture-plan.test.ts:13-20` and `src/commands/complete-task-workflow.test.ts:7-22`.

## Implementation Details

### Key File Patterns Discovered
- **Hook Testing**: `src/hooks/capture-plan.test.ts:88-236` shows hook dependency injection pattern
- **Command Testing**: `src/commands/complete-task-workflow.test.ts:23-162` shows git workflow simulation
- **Mock Setup**: `src/test-utils/command-mocks.ts:454-549` provides complete mock command dependencies
- **Git Helpers**: `src/lib/git-helpers.test.ts:15-27` shows git command mocking patterns
- **Temp Git Repos**: `scripts/bench-stop-review.ts:19-38` shows real git repo creation pattern

### Integration Test Infrastructure Functions
```typescript
// Based on existing patterns in src/test-utils/command-mocks.ts
- createTempGitRepo(): Initialize temp git repo with commits (following bench-stop-review pattern)
- createTempProject(): Set up full cc-track project structure with .claude/ directory  
- runHookChain(): Execute multiple hooks in sequence using existing hook dispatcher
- captureSystemState(): Snapshot files, git state, logs for assertion
- ClaudeSDKStub: Controllable stub for Claude API calls (extend existing createMockClaudeSDK)
- GitHubAPIStub: Mock GitHub operations with validation (extend existing createMockGitHubHelpers)
```

### Hook Chain Integration Pattern
Based on `src/commands/hook.ts:18-72` hook dispatcher and `src/hooks/capture-plan.test.ts:163-236`:
```typescript
async function runHookChain(hooks: Array<{event: string, toolName?: string}>, tempProjectDir: string) {
  // Use existing determineHookType and hookHandlers from hook.ts:18-72
  // Follow dependency injection pattern from capture-plan.test.ts:99-219
  // Return combined results for assertion
}
```

### Temporary Git Repository Pattern
Following `scripts/bench-stop-review.ts:33-37`:
```typescript
function createTempGitRepo(baseDir: string): TempGitRepo {
  // mkdirSync(tempDir, { recursive: true })
  // execSync('git init -q', tempDir)
  // execSync('git config user.email test@example.com', tempDir)
  // execSync('git config user.name test', tempDir)
  // Create initial commit
  // Return cleanup function
}
```

### Context Management Testing  
Based on `src/lib/claude-md.ts:17-100` and existing file handling patterns:
```typescript
// Test CLAUDE.md @import system updates
// Test task file creation and status transitions
// Test no_active_task.md <-> TASK_XXX.md switching (claude-md.ts:92-98)
// Test decision log and system patterns updates
```

## Current Focus

Task completed on 2025-09-18

## Research Findings
- **Comprehensive Test Utilities**: `src/test-utils/command-mocks.ts` provides 550 lines of mature mock infrastructure
- **Dependency Injection Pattern**: All commands and hooks use DI for testability (seen in context.ts:91-106)
- **Hook Dispatcher**: `src/commands/hook.ts:66-72` provides central registry for all hook handlers
- **Git Temp Repos**: `scripts/bench-stop-review.ts` demonstrates real git repo creation pattern  
- **Test Organization**: 29 existing .test.ts files follow consistent patterns with beforeEach/afterEach mock restoration
- **Mock Sophistication**: Existing mocks handle complex scenarios like git command sequences, file system operations, Claude SDK calls
- **Configuration Patterns**: `src/lib/config.ts` and track.config.json provide feature flags for testing different system states

## Implementation Priority
1. **Task Lifecycle Tests** (highest value) - Test complete plan → completion → PR workflow
2. **Hook Chain Tests** (catch most integration bugs) - Test edit → validation → stop-review → auto-commit chains  
3. **Git Operations Tests** (critical for reliability) - Test real git operations in temporary repos
4. **Context Management Tests** (validate core functionality) - Test CLAUDE.md imports and task file management
5. **Configuration Tests** (lower priority) - Test feature flag propagation and settings.json changes

## Next Steps
1. Create `src/test-utils/integration-helpers.ts` extending existing command-mocks.ts patterns
2. Implement `createTempGitRepo()` and `createTempProject()` functions following bench-stop-review.ts:19-38
3. Add `runHookChain()` helper using existing hook dispatcher from hook.ts:66-72  
4. Create first task lifecycle test in `src/integration-tests/task-lifecycle.test.ts`
5. Test the infrastructure and refine based on actual usage patterns
6. Implement remaining test categories following established patterns

## Open Questions & Blockers
- None identified - existing codebase provides comprehensive patterns and infrastructure for integration testing
- All necessary dependencies (Bun test framework, mock utilities, git operations) are already available
- Test infrastructure can build directly on proven patterns from 29 existing unit test files

## Estimated Effort
- Infrastructure setup: 4-6 hours (extending existing utilities)
- Test implementation: 8-10 hours (following established patterns)  
- Total: ~2 days of focused work

These integration tests will complement the existing 366 unit tests perfectly, providing confidence that the system works end-to-end while maintaining fast unit tests for rapid feedback during development.
