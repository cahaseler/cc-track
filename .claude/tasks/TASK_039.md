# Integrate Claude Code TypeScript SDK into cc-track

**Purpose:** Replace CLI-based Claude interactions with the official TypeScript SDK to improve performance, reliability, and enable advanced features like controlled agents

**Status:** planning
**Started:** 2025-09-12 14:28
**Task ID:** 039

## Requirements
- [ ] Install `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` SDK dependency
- [ ] Create proof-of-concept test script to validate Pro subscription works
- [ ] Verify SDK works without API key using existing Pro subscription
- [ ] Create SDK wrapper class with methods for current use cases
- [ ] Implement `generateCommitMessage()` method
- [ ] Implement `generateBranchName()` method  
- [ ] Implement `reviewCode()` method
- [ ] Implement `enrichTask()` method
- [ ] Implement `extractPatterns()` method
- [ ] Migrate existing CLI calls in GitHelpers to SDK calls
- [ ] Update hooks to use new SDK wrapper
- [ ] Ensure all functionality works identically to CLI version

## Success Criteria
- SDK installed successfully without errors
- Test script runs and receives responses using Pro subscription
- No authentication errors or API key requirements
- All existing Claude functionality works through SDK
- Performance improvement over CLI calls
- No regression in existing features

## Technical Approach
Three-phase approach starting with proof-of-concept validation:
1. **Phase 1:** Install SDK and create minimal test to validate Pro subscription works
2. **Phase 2:** Build clean wrapper abstraction and migrate existing CLI calls  
3. **Phase 3:** Explore advanced capabilities like controlled agents (future work)

## Current Focus
Create proof-of-concept test script in `src/lib/claude-sdk-test.ts` with minimal Claude query to validate the SDK works with existing Pro subscription before any refactoring.

## Open Questions & Blockers
- Will the SDK automatically use the existing Pro subscription or require additional configuration?
- Are there any performance differences between SDK and CLI approaches?
- What SDK-specific features might benefit our use cases?

## Next Steps
1. Install the `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` package
2. Create simple test script with basic Claude query
3. Run test to validate Pro subscription integration
4. Proceed to wrapper creation only after successful validation
