# Integrate Claude Code TypeScript SDK into cc-track

**Purpose:** Replace CLI-based Claude interactions with the official TypeScript SDK to improve performance, reliability, and enable advanced features like controlled agents

**Status:** in_progress
**Started:** 2025-09-12 14:28
**Task ID:** 039

## Requirements
- [x] Install `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` SDK dependency
- [x] Create proof-of-concept test script to validate Pro subscription works
- [x] Verify SDK works without API key using existing Pro subscription
- [x] Create SDK wrapper class with methods for current use cases
- [x] Implement `generateCommitMessage()` method
- [x] Implement `generateBranchName()` method  
- [x] Implement `reviewCode()` method
- [x] Implement `enrichTask()` method (for capture-plan hook)
- [x] Implement `extractPatterns()` method
- [x] Migrate existing CLI calls in GitHelpers to SDK calls
- [ ] Update stop-review hook to use new SDK wrapper
- [ ] Update capture-plan hook to use new SDK wrapper
- [ ] Update pre-compact hook to use new SDK wrapper
- [ ] Ensure all functionality works identically to CLI version

## Success Criteria
- SDK installed successfully without errors
- Test script runs and receives responses using Pro subscription
- No authentication errors or API key requirements
- All existing Claude functionality works through SDK
- Performance improvement over CLI calls
- No regression in existing features

## Technical Approach
Three-phase approach starting with proof-of-concept validation:
1. **Phase 1:** Install SDK and create minimal test to validate Pro subscription works
2. **Phase 2:** Build clean wrapper abstraction and migrate existing CLI calls  
3. **Phase 3:** Explore advanced capabilities like controlled agents (future work)

## Current Focus
Migrating existing CLI calls to use the SDK wrapper. GitHelpers migration complete, now working on hooks.

## Questions Resolved
- âœ… SDK automatically uses existing Pro subscription (apiKeySource: 'none' confirmed)
- âœ… Performance is similar but cleaner (no temp files, no subprocess overhead)
- âœ… SDK provides structured responses, better error handling, and tool restrictions

## Progress Log
- âœ… Successfully installed SDK and validated Pro subscription works (apiKeySource: 'none')
- âœ… Created comprehensive SDK wrapper class with all needed methods
- âœ… Migrated GitHelpers to use SDK instead of CLI
- ðŸ”„ Currently migrating hooks to use SDK

## Next Steps
1. Complete migration of stop-review hook
2. Migrate capture-plan hook
3. Migrate pre-compact hook
4. Test all functionality end-to-end
5. Remove old temp file handling code
