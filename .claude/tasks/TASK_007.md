# Add Configuration System to cc-pars

**Purpose:** Create a configuration system that allows users to enable/disable individual hooks and customize cc-pars behavior

**Status:** completed
**Started:** 2025-09-10 07:14
**Task ID:** 007

## Requirements
- [x] Create `.claude/cc-pars.config.json` configuration file
- [x] Create `.claude/lib/config.ts` helper module with config management functions
- [x] Update all hooks to check if they're enabled before executing
- [x] Create `/config-cc-pars` slash command for user-friendly configuration
- [x] Test that hooks exit silently when disabled
- [x] Ensure configuration persists across sessions

## Success Criteria
- Users can enable/disable individual hooks via slash command
- Disabled hooks exit cleanly without errors
- Configuration changes take effect immediately
- Natural language commands work (e.g., "disable task creation")
- Config file is human-readable and editable

## Technical Approach
Create a JSON configuration file that stores enable/disable state for each hook and feature. Implement a TypeScript helper module that provides functions to read and update the configuration. Each hook checks its enabled state at startup and exits silently if disabled. A slash command provides a user-friendly interface for configuration using natural language parsing.

## Implementation Details
- Config file location: `.claude/cc-pars.config.json`
- Config helper: `.claude/lib/config.ts` with `getConfig()`, `isHookEnabled()`, `setHookEnabled()`
- Hook pattern: Check `isHookEnabled()` at start, return `{continue: true}` if disabled
- Command supports: `/config-cc-pars [enable|disable] [hook name]`

## Completion Summary
Successfully implemented a flexible configuration system for cc-pars:

### Delivered
- **Configuration file** (`.claude/cc-pars.config.json`) storing enable/disable settings for all hooks
- **Config helper module** (`.claude/lib/config.ts`) providing type-safe configuration management
- **Updated all 4 hooks** to respect their enabled state and exit cleanly when disabled
- **Slash command** (`/config-cc-pars`) with natural language support for easy configuration
- **Model optimization fix**: Changed task enrichment from Haiku to Sonnet for reliability

### Key Implementation Details
- Config helper searches up directory tree to find config file from any subdirectory
- Hooks return `{continue: true}` when disabled for clean exit
- Configuration changes apply immediately without restart
- Natural language mapping handles variations like "task creation", "capture plan", etc.

### Testing Verified
- Disabled hooks exit silently without performing actions
- Configuration persists across invocations
- Config file updates correctly via helper functions

### Lessons Learned
- Haiku model insufficient for complex structured output generation (task enrichment)
- Sonnet provides better reliability for task structure while still being cost-effective
- Early exit pattern in hooks minimizes overhead when features are disabled
