# TASK_057: Remove Post-Compact/SessionStart Hook

## Purpose
Remove the redundant post-compact/SessionStart hook system since its functionality is already covered by pre-compact hooks and Claude Code's native context loading after compaction.

## Status
in_progress

## Requirements
- [x] Delete `src/hooks/post-compact.ts`
- [x] Delete `src/hooks/post-compact.test.ts`
- [x] Remove SessionStart hook section from `.claude/settings.json` (lines 52-63)
- [x] Remove post_compact entry from `.claude/track.config.json` (lines 11-14)
- [x] Remove post_compact from `templates/track.config.json`
- [x] Remove post-compact case from `src/commands/hook.ts`
- [x] Remove import statement for postCompactHook from `src/commands/hook.ts`
- [x] Remove any SessionStart hook setup from `src/commands/init.ts`
- [x] Remove SessionStart from HookEventName in `src/types.ts` if present
- [x] Update `src/commands/hook.test.ts` to remove post-compact tests
- [x] Update `src/lib/config.test.ts` if it has post-compact references
- [x] Remove post-compact references from code_index.md
- [x] Clean up any other documentation mentioning post-compact/SessionStart
- [x] Remove item #6 about reviewing session start hook instructions from backlog
- [x] Remove item #9 about stop-review message filtering from backlog (already implemented)

## Success Criteria
- All post-compact/SessionStart hook files and references are completely removed
- Configuration files no longer contain post-compact entries
- Hook dispatcher no longer handles post-compact events
- All tests pass after removal
- No broken references or imports remain
- Documentation is updated to reflect the removal

## Technical Approach
1. **File Deletion**: Remove the core hook implementation files
2. **Configuration Cleanup**: Remove hook configurations from settings and tracking files
3. **Code References**: Remove imports, case handlers, and type definitions
4. **Test Updates**: Remove or update tests that reference the removed functionality
5. **Documentation**: Clean up all documentation references

## Recent Progress
- Successfully deleted both post-compact hook implementation files (post-compact.ts and post-compact.test.ts)
- Removed SessionStart hook configuration from all settings.json files
- Updated track.config.json files (both project and template) to remove post_compact entries
- Cleaned up hook dispatcher to remove all post-compact handling and imports
- Updated init command to remove SessionStart setup instructions
- Fixed embedded resources to remove post_compact from templates and commands
- Updated all test files to remove post-compact related tests
- Cleaned up config.ts to remove default post_compact configuration
- Updated code_index.md documentation to remove post-compact references
- Removed completed backlog items #6 and #9
