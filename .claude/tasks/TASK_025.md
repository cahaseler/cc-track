# GitHub Integration Implementation

**Purpose:** Implement comprehensive GitHub integration that automatically creates issues for tasks, manages branches via `gh issue develop`, and opens PRs instead of merging. Also set up the current repository on GitHub.

**Status:** completed
**Started:** 2025-09-11 21:44
**Task ID:** 025

## Requirements

### Phase 1: Configuration & Setup
- [ ] Add `github_integration` feature to track.config.json with sub-options:
  - [ ] `enabled: boolean` - master toggle
  - [ ] `auto_create_issues: boolean` - create GitHub issues for tasks
  - [ ] `use_issue_branches: boolean` - use `gh issue develop` for branches
  - [ ] `auto_create_prs: boolean` - open PRs instead of merging
  - [ ] `repository_url: string` - GitHub repo URL for validation
- [ ] Extend HookConfig interface in lib/config.ts to support GitHub settings
- [ ] Add validation functions to ensure `gh` CLI is available and repo is connected
- [ ] Add helper functions to detect if current repo has GitHub remote

### Phase 2: Task Creation Integration
- [ ] Enhance capture_plan.ts hook to create GitHub issues when enabled
- [ ] Extract task title and description from plan
- [ ] Create GitHub issue using `gh issue create`
- [ ] Store issue number in task file metadata
- [ ] Use `gh issue develop -c` to create and switch to linked branch
- [ ] Implement fallback to existing git branching if GitHub operations fail
- [ ] Handle edge cases: no network, API limits, authentication issues

### Phase 3: Task Completion Integration
- [ ] Update complete-task.ts script to push branch and skip merge when GitHub integration enabled
- [ ] Enhance complete-task.md command with GitHub workflow section
- [ ] Add instructions for Claude to create PR using `gh pr create`
- [ ] Add logic to switch back to default branch after PR creation
- [ ] Provide PR URL to user

### Phase 4: GitHub Repository Setup
- [ ] Create cahaseler/cc-track repository using `gh repo create`
- [ ] Set description: "Task Review And Context Keeper - Keep your vibe coding on track"
- [ ] Add topics: claude-code, task-management, context-preservation
- [ ] Add and commit all current work
- [ ] Push to new repository
- [ ] Update configuration to point to new repo
- [ ] Verify GitHub integration works end-to-end

### Phase 5: Error Handling & Edge Cases
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation when `gh` CLI not available
- [ ] Handle authentication failures
- [ ] Fall back to local git operations when GitHub unavailable
- [ ] Add clear error messages for configuration issues
- [ ] Validate GitHub remote exists before attempting operations
- [ ] Check for uncommitted changes before branch operations
- [ ] Validate issue numbers and branch names

## Success Criteria
- [ ] GitHub integration can be enabled/disabled via configuration
- [ ] Tasks automatically create GitHub issues and linked branches when enabled
- [ ] Task completion creates PRs instead of merging when enabled
- [ ] All existing functionality works when GitHub integration is disabled
- [ ] Repository is successfully set up on GitHub with proper metadata
- [ ] Error handling provides clear feedback and graceful fallbacks
- [ ] Integration doesn't break existing git branching features

## Technical Approach
- Create new GitHub helper library for API wrapper functions
- Extend existing configuration system with GitHub-specific settings
- Modify capture_plan.ts hook to integrate issue creation
- Update complete-task.ts script and command to support PR workflow
- Use `gh` CLI for all GitHub operations to leverage existing authentication
- Implement validation and error handling throughout

## Current Focus

Task completed on 2025-09-11

## Open Questions & Blockers
- Need to verify `gh` CLI is available in the environment
- Need to determine optimal error handling strategy for network/auth failures
- Should consider rate limiting for GitHub API operations
- Need to test interaction between existing git hooks and new GitHub features

## Completion Summary

**Delivered:**
- Comprehensive GitHub integration with automatic issue creation and PR workflow
- GitHub helpers library with full gh CLI wrapper functions
- Dual workflow support (traditional git merge OR GitHub PR workflow)
- Configuration system with granular control over GitHub features
- Enhanced capture_plan hook to create issues when tasks are created
- Updated complete-task script to handle both workflows intelligently
- Simplified config-track command documentation

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Used gh CLI for all GitHub operations (authentication, issue creation, PR management)
- Graceful degradation when GitHub unavailable - falls back to local git operations
- Issue-branch linking via `gh issue develop` for proper GitHub integration
- Validation at every step with proper error messages
- Configuration allows partial adoption (just issues, just PRs, or both)

**Testing Results:**
- TypeScript: ✓ No errors
- Biome: ✓ No linting issues  
- Pre-push validation: ✓ All checks pass
- GitHub repository created and connected successfully
- Configuration system tested and working

**Note:** Since this task was created before GitHub integration was enabled, there's no associated GitHub issue. Future tasks will automatically create issues and use the full PR workflow.
