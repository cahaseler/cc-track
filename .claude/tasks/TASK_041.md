# Add Three Test Functions to capture-plan.test.ts

**Purpose:** Add comprehensive test coverage to the capture-plan test file with three new test functions focusing on GitHub integration, git branching configuration, and error recovery scenarios.

**Status:** planning
**Started:** 2025-09-13 17:13
**Task ID:** 041

## Requirements
- [ ] Add test for GitHub integration path in `capturePlanHook` describe block
- [ ] Mock GitHub issue creation functionality
- [ ] Verify issue-based branch naming patterns
- [ ] Check that task file includes GitHub issue reference
- [ ] Add test for git branching configuration scenarios
- [ ] Test behavior when git branching is disabled (stay on current branch)
- [ ] Test behavior when git branching is enabled (create feature branch)
- [ ] Verify correct branch naming patterns for both scenarios
- [ ] Add test for error recovery and logging functionality
- [ ] Test behavior when task directory creation fails
- [ ] Test behavior when Claude SDK enrichment fails but fallback works
- [ ] Verify appropriate error logging and user messages
- [ ] Follow established patterns in the file using proper mocks
- [ ] Use dependency injection patterns consistent with existing tests

## Success Criteria
- Three new test functions added to capture-plan.test.ts
- All tests pass and integrate with existing test suite
- Enhanced coverage of GitHub integration workflows
- Enhanced coverage of git branching configuration
- Enhanced coverage of error handling and recovery paths
- Tests follow established mocking and dependency injection patterns
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Technical Approach
Add three distinct test functions within the existing `capturePlanHook` describe block:
1. GitHub integration test with mocked issue creation and branch naming verification
2. Git branching configuration test covering enabled/disabled scenarios
3. Error recovery test with failure simulation and logging verification

## Current Focus
Examine existing capture-plan.test.ts file structure and patterns to understand current testing approach and mocking strategies.

## Open Questions & Blockers
- Need to review current test file structure and mocking patterns
- Need to understand existing GitHub integration implementation
- Need to identify current git branching configuration options
- Need to understand error handling patterns in the codebase

## Next Steps
1. Read capture-plan.test.ts to understand existing structure
2. Identify GitHub integration and git branching implementation details
3. Design test cases following established patterns
4. Implement the three new test functions
5. Verify tests pass and provide adequate coverage
