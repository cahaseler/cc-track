# Refactor cc-track to CLI Tool Architecture with Tests

**Purpose:** Transform cc-track from a collection of stdin/stdout scripts into a professional CLI tool with comprehensive test coverage using Commander.js and Bun's testing framework.

**Status:** completed
**Started:** 2025-09-11 23:02
**Completed:** 2025-09-11 23:58
**Task ID:** 026

## Requirements
- [x] Create /src folder structure with organized directories (cli, commands, hooks, lib)
- [x] Add commander dependency for CLI framework
- [x] Transform hooks from stdin/stdout scripts to pure functions
- [x] Create hook dispatcher in commands/hook.ts to handle stdin/stdout once
- [x] Implement CLI entry point with Commander.js structure
- [x] Write comprehensive tests for all hook functions using Bun test
- [x] Write tests for library functions (config, logger, git-helpers, github-helpers)
- [x] Create init command for project initialization
- [x] Create backlog command for adding items
- [x] Create complete-task command for task completion
- [x] Build compiled binary with bun build --compile
- [x] Update settings.json to use compiled binary instead of bun run
- [x] Maintain backwards compatibility with existing JSON interface
- [x] Preserve all existing functionality during refactor
- [x] Write tests for CLI commands (init, backlog, complete-task, hook)
- [x] Fix all linting errors and ensure TypeScript compliance

## Success Criteria
- All hooks converted to pure functions with comprehensive test coverage
- CLI tool works identically to current stdin/stdout implementation
- All tests pass with >90% coverage
- Compiled binary executes all hook types successfully
- settings.json updated and working with new binary
- No breaking changes to existing Claude Code integration
- Clean, maintainable code structure following modern CLI patterns

## Technical Approach
- Use Commander.js for professional CLI structure with help, version, error handling
- Implement single stdin/stdout handler in commands/hook.ts that dispatches to pure hook functions
- Convert each hook script to pure function (input parameter → output return)
- Use Bun's built-in testing framework for fast, reliable tests
- Mock file system operations and external commands in tests
- Maintain identical JSON input/output interface for Claude Code compatibility
- Keep original .claude/ files untouched during development for safety

## Recent Progress
- Successfully created /src directory structure 
- Added commander.js dependency after discussing tradeoffs with Craig
- Refactored all lib modules with dependency injection pattern:
  - config.ts (9 tests passing)
  - logger.ts (10 tests passing)
  - git-helpers.ts (22 tests passing)  
  - github-helpers.ts (23 tests passing)
- Refactored ALL hooks as pure functions with comprehensive tests:
  - edit-validation.ts (16 tests passing)
  - pre-compact.ts (24 tests passing - preserved ALL complex functionality including ErrorPatternExtractor)
  - capture-plan.ts (20 tests passing - preserved task creation, Claude CLI enrichment, git branching, GitHub integration)
  - post-compact.ts (14 tests passing)
  - stop-review.ts (28 tests passing - preserved entire SessionReviewer class with all methods + fixed large diff handling)
- Implemented CLI entry point with Commander.js at src/cli/index.ts
- Created hook dispatcher in src/commands/hook.ts that reads stdin once and dispatches to pure functions
- Built compiled binary (96MB) at dist/cc-track
- Updated settings.json to use compiled binary instead of bun scripts
- Fixed stop-review hook to handle large diffs correctly (still commits with [wip] when review fails)
- Created tests for CLI commands (init, backlog, complete-task, hook) with structural validation
- Fixed all linting errors and TypeScript compliance issues (all tests now pass lint and typecheck)
- Updated all slash commands in .claude/commands/ to use compiled binary instead of bun scripts  
- **RESTORED MISSING FUNCTIONALITY** from original implementation:
  - complete-task: Full JSON output, validation checks, GitHub workflows, no_active_task updates, safe git operations  
  - init: Smart CLAUDE.md merging with backup, proper settings location, original directory structure
  - git-session: All utilities (show-revert, squash, show-wip, diff, prepare-push) as CLI subcommands
- **FUNCTIONALITY GAP RESOLUTION** verified by automated code reviewer:
  - All critical gaps in @docs/command_functionality_differences_codex.md resolved
  - Reviewer initially challenged restoration, then conceded all gaps were properly fixed
  - Fixed import issue in git-helpers.ts (execSync references) per reviewer feedback
- Total: 191 tests passing with 0 linting/type errors, TypeScript compilation clean
- **POST-COMPACTION FIX**: Fixed critical issue where tests were making REAL Claude API calls (costing money!)
  - Root cause: GitHelpers wasn't properly mocked in capture-plan and stop-review tests
  - Impact: Tests taking 10+ seconds, actual API charges incurred
  - Resolution: Added proper mocks for GitHelpers methods, tests now run in milliseconds
  - Final: 207 tests passing with proper mocking, no external service calls
- **TEST COVERAGE EXPANSION**: Added comprehensive tests for pure functions per Craig's request
  - Added boundary value tests for getCostEmoji (statusline command)
  - Added tests for generateUserSummary (post-compact hook)
  - Added skip tasks test for readImportedFiles (post-compact hook)
  - Added proper tests for runTypeScriptCheck and runBiomeCheck (edit-validation hook)
  - Note: Initially wrote incorrect tests without checking function signatures, then fixed with proper implementations
  - Final: 252 tests passing, all running in ~300ms total

## Decisions Made During Implementation

### Approved Improvements vs Strict Backward Compatibility
- **Completed timestamp addition**: APPROVED as improvement - adds `**Completed:** <date time>` field that original didn't have
- **Settings file location**: ACKNOWLEDGED as needing future refactor - uses `.claude/claude_code_settings.json` vs original approach
- **Command template copying**: APPROVED as improvement - copies .md command help files to `.claude/commands/`
- **Multi-item backlog support**: APPROVED as improvement - `--list` flag and multiple items vs original single-item only
- **Git-session utilities**: CONFIRMED as valuable - user stated "I had noticed you using all but prepare-push during your workflows when things got off track, so there's real value in them"

### Technical Architecture Decisions  
- **Commander.js**: Chosen over minimal approach for better CLI experience, help, version, error handling
- **Dependency injection**: Adopted throughout for testability (replacing problematic mock.module())
- **JSON compatibility**: Maintained identical input/output interface for Claude Code hook compatibility
- **Error handling**: Enhanced with structured logging and proper exit codes while preserving behavior

### Future Work Scope Decisions
- **Init script refactor**: DEFERRED - "we're going to need to do a better refactor of the init scripts later anyway since the scope has grown so much, so I am okay with leaving it"
- **Settings file approach**: Acceptable for now, will be addressed in future comprehensive init refactor

## Resolved Issues
- ✅ Commander.js chosen over minimal approach for better QoL features  
- ✅ Dependency injection pattern adopted for testability
- ✅ Must preserve ALL hook functionality (not simplify) during refactor
- ✅ Test isolation issue fixed by using dependency injection instead of mock.module()
- ✅ Binary builds successfully with all dependencies (96MB)  
- ✅ Stop-review hook now correctly handles large diffs by still committing with [wip]
- ✅ Automated code reviewer validation: Initially challenged, then confirmed all functionality gaps resolved
- ✅ Import correctness: Fixed execSync references in git-helpers.ts per reviewer feedback

## Completion Summary

### Deliverables
- **Professional CLI Architecture**: Complete Commander.js-based CLI with subcommands, help, version, error handling
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: 191 tests passing across all commands, hooks, and library functions
- **Full Backward Compatibility**: Identical JSON input/output interface maintains Claude Code integration
- **Compiled Binary**: 96MB standalone executable at `dist/cc-track`
- **Updated Integrations**: All slash commands and settings.json updated to use new binary

### Functionality Verification
- **Complete-task command**: JSON output ✅, validation checks ✅, GitHub workflows ✅, no_active_task updates ✅, safe git operations ✅
- **Init command**: Smart CLAUDE.md merging ✅, proper directory structure ✅, template handling ✅  
- **Git-session utilities**: All 5 commands implemented ✅ (show-revert, squash, show-wip, diff, prepare-push)
- **Hook dispatcher**: Centralized handler with proper exit codes ✅
- **Library functions**: All refactored with dependency injection and comprehensive tests ✅

### Quality Assurance
- **Code Review**: Automated reviewer initially challenged, then confirmed all functionality gaps resolved
- **Import Correctness**: Fixed execSync references per reviewer feedback  
- **Linting & Type Safety**: 0 linting errors, clean TypeScript compilation
- **Test Reliability**: Dependency injection pattern resolved test isolation issues

## Final Status: ✅ COMPLETE
All requirements fulfilled. CLI tool provides professional architecture with full backward compatibility and comprehensive test coverage. Ready for production use.
