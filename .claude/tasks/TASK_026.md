# Refactor cc-track to CLI Tool Architecture with Tests

**Purpose:** Transform cc-track from a collection of stdin/stdout scripts into a professional CLI tool with comprehensive test coverage using Commander.js and Bun's testing framework.

**Status:** in-progress
**Started:** 2025-09-11 23:02
**Task ID:** 026

## Requirements
- [x] Create /src folder structure with organized directories (cli, commands, hooks, lib)
- [x] Add commander dependency for CLI framework
- [x] Transform hooks from stdin/stdout scripts to pure functions
- [x] Create hook dispatcher in commands/hook.ts to handle stdin/stdout once
- [x] Implement CLI entry point with Commander.js structure
- [x] Write comprehensive tests for all hook functions using Bun test
- [x] Write tests for library functions (config, logger, git-helpers, github-helpers)
- [x] Create init command for project initialization
- [x] Create backlog command for adding items
- [x] Create complete-task command for task completion
- [x] Build compiled binary with bun build --compile
- [x] Update settings.json to use compiled binary instead of bun run
- [x] Maintain backwards compatibility with existing JSON interface
- [x] Preserve all existing functionality during refactor
- [x] Write tests for CLI commands (init, backlog, complete-task, hook)
- [x] Fix all linting errors and ensure TypeScript compliance

## Success Criteria
- All hooks converted to pure functions with comprehensive test coverage
- CLI tool works identically to current stdin/stdout implementation
- All tests pass with >90% coverage
- Compiled binary executes all hook types successfully
- settings.json updated and working with new binary
- No breaking changes to existing Claude Code integration
- Clean, maintainable code structure following modern CLI patterns

## Technical Approach
- Use Commander.js for professional CLI structure with help, version, error handling
- Implement single stdin/stdout handler in commands/hook.ts that dispatches to pure hook functions
- Convert each hook script to pure function (input parameter → output return)
- Use Bun's built-in testing framework for fast, reliable tests
- Mock file system operations and external commands in tests
- Maintain identical JSON input/output interface for Claude Code compatibility
- Keep original .claude/ files untouched during development for safety

## Recent Progress
- Successfully created /src directory structure 
- Added commander.js dependency after discussing tradeoffs with Craig
- Refactored all lib modules with dependency injection pattern:
  - config.ts (9 tests passing)
  - logger.ts (10 tests passing)
  - git-helpers.ts (22 tests passing)  
  - github-helpers.ts (23 tests passing)
- Refactored ALL hooks as pure functions with comprehensive tests:
  - edit-validation.ts (16 tests passing)
  - pre-compact.ts (24 tests passing - preserved ALL complex functionality including ErrorPatternExtractor)
  - capture-plan.ts (20 tests passing - preserved task creation, Claude CLI enrichment, git branching, GitHub integration)
  - post-compact.ts (14 tests passing)
  - stop-review.ts (28 tests passing - preserved entire SessionReviewer class with all methods + fixed large diff handling)
- Implemented CLI entry point with Commander.js at src/cli/index.ts
- Created hook dispatcher in src/commands/hook.ts that reads stdin once and dispatches to pure functions
- Built compiled binary (96MB) at dist/cc-track
- Updated settings.json to use compiled binary instead of bun scripts
- Fixed stop-review hook to handle large diffs correctly (still commits with [wip] when review fails)
- Created tests for CLI commands (init, backlog, complete-task, hook) with structural validation
- Fixed all linting errors and TypeScript compliance issues (all tests now pass lint and typecheck)
- Updated all slash commands in .claude/commands/ to use compiled binary instead of bun scripts
- Total: 186 tests passing with 0 linting/type errors

## Current Focus
**VALIDATION PHASE** - All requirements implemented, now validating and testing CLI tool functionality to ensure it works correctly before marking complete

## Open Questions & Blockers
- ✅ Resolved: Commander.js chosen over minimal approach for better QoL features
- ✅ Resolved: Dependency injection pattern adopted for testability
- ✅ Resolved: Must preserve ALL hook functionality (not simplify) during refactor
- ✅ Resolved: Test isolation issue fixed by using dependency injection instead of mock.module()
- ✅ Resolved: Binary builds successfully with all dependencies (96MB)
- ✅ Resolved: stop-review hook now correctly handles large diffs by still committing with [wip]

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Complete tests for pre-compact hook
2. ✅ Refactor remaining hooks (capture-plan, post-compact, stop-review)
3. ✅ Write tests for remaining hooks  
4. ✅ Implement CLI entry point with commander
5. ✅ Create hook dispatcher to handle stdin/stdout
6. ✅ Build and test compiled binary
7. Create init command for project initialization
8. Create backlog command for adding items
9. Create complete-task command for task completion
