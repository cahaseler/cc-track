# TASK_064: Refactor Commands for Testability and Comprehensive Unit Tests

## Purpose
Refactor every CLI command to use explicit dependency injection so their business logic is isolated from Commander wiring, enabling thorough unit tests that cover success and failure scenarios without touching the real filesystem, Git, or external CLIs.

## Status
**in_progress**

## Requirements
- [x] Introduce a shared command dependency context module that exposes default adapters and injectable interfaces for console, process, filesystem, git, GitHub, child process, logging, and time utilities
- [x] Refactor simple commands (`init`, `setup-commands`, `setup-templates`, `backlog`, `parse-logs`) to use the new context and return structured results instead of calling globals
- [x] Refactor mid-complexity commands (`statusline`, `prepare-completion`, `hook`, `git-session`) to follow the same pattern with extracted pure action functions
- [x] Refactor complex commands (`create-task-from-issue`) into smaller injectable units that cover filesystem updates, git workflow, and GitHub integration without direct `process.exit`
- [x] Refactor `complete-task` into injectable components that emulate the legacy behaviour (validation → docs → git → GitHub) while returning structured results
- [x] Update CLI registration to instantiate commands via new factory functions and ensure Commander wiring remains intact
- [x] Add comprehensive unit test suites for each converted command action covering happy paths, validation errors, and dependency failures using stubbed dependencies
- [x] Add light smoke tests for the Commander wrappers to confirm option/argument wiring and result-to-exit-code translation
- [x] Run repository lint, typecheck, and test commands to verify the refactor passes existing quality gates (done incrementally for converted commands; final run pending once `complete-task` is migrated)

## Success Criteria
- [x] All converted command unit tests execute without invoking real child processes, Git commands, or filesystem writes
- [x] Converted commands no longer call `process.exit` or `console` directly from business logic; wrappers handle user IO and exit codes
- [x] `complete-task` matches the DI pattern and its success/error paths are fully covered by tests
- [x] Final `bun test` / lint / typecheck pass after all commands are converted
- [x] CLI behaviour remains consistent for end users (no changes to command names, flags, or outputs beyond improved error handling)

## Technical Approach (Revised)
1. Context module (`src/commands/context.ts`) created with `CommandDeps`, default adapters, `CommandResult`, and helper utilities.
2. Each command now exposes pure helpers (e.g., `runBacklog`, `showRevert`) returning `CommandResult`s; Commander wrappers (`createXCommand`) resolve default deps and handle IO/exit codes.
3. Shared test utilities (mock deps) are included in new command test suites to cover success/failure branches.
4. Remaining scope is to break down `complete-task` into injectable phases (validation, doc updates, git ops, GitHub/PR flow), return structured results, and add unit coverage. **(Completed)**
5. After `complete-task`, revisit CLI registration/`src/cli/index.ts` to ensure all commands use factory wrappers. **(Verified, no changes required)**
6. Run a comprehensive `bun test` plus lint/typecheck once all commands are converted. **(Completed)**

## Recent Progress
- Added `src/commands/context.ts` providing common DI infrastructure and helper utilities (with unit tests in `context.test.ts`).
- Refactored simple commands (`init`, `setup-commands`, `setup-templates`, `backlog`, `parse-logs`) to use the DI pattern; added dedicated tests for each.
- Converted mid-complexity commands (`statusline`, `prepare-completion`, `hook`, `git-session`) to DI style and wrote unit coverage for their core helpers.
- Refactored `create-task-from-issue` into small injectable steps and added focused tests.
- Verified `bun test` passes after each conversion (latest run includes all converted commands).
- Completed `complete-task` refactor to use the DI context, decomposed workflow helpers, and added focused unit tests plus wrapper smoke coverage.
- Updated supporting command modules/tests for new context typing adjustments; ensured lint/typecheck compatibility and reorganized imports across the suite.
- Validated repository with `bun run typecheck`, `bun run lint`, and `bun test` after the full refactor.

## Next Steps
1. Monitor for any regressions or follow-up adjustments requested during review; document lessons learned if new patterns emerge.
2. Coordinate with maintainers on any downstream tasks (e.g., additional docs) before closing Task 064.
