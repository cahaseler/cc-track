# TASK_064: Refactor Commands for Testability and Comprehensive Unit Tests

## Purpose
Refactor every CLI command to use explicit dependency injection so their business logic is isolated from Commander wiring, enabling thorough unit tests that cover success and failure scenarios without touching the real filesystem, Git, or external CLIs.

## Status
**in_progress**

## Requirements
- [x] Introduce a shared command dependency context module that exposes default adapters and injectable interfaces for console, process, filesystem, git, GitHub, child process, logging, and time utilities
- [x] Refactor simple commands (`init`, `setup-commands`, `setup-templates`, `backlog`, `parse-logs`) to use the new context and return structured results instead of calling globals
- [x] Refactor mid-complexity commands (`statusline`, `prepare-completion`, `hook`, `git-session`) to follow the same pattern with extracted pure action functions
- [x] Refactor complex commands (`create-task-from-issue`) into smaller injectable units that cover filesystem updates, git workflow, and GitHub integration without direct `process.exit`
- [x] Refactor `complete-task` into injectable components that emulate the legacy behaviour (validation → docs → git → GitHub) while returning structured results
- [x] Update CLI registration to instantiate commands via new factory functions and ensure Commander wiring remains intact
- [x] Add comprehensive unit test suites for each converted command action covering happy paths, validation errors, and dependency failures using stubbed dependencies
- [x] Add light smoke tests for the Commander wrappers to confirm option/argument wiring and result-to-exit-code translation
- [x] Run repository lint, typecheck, and test commands to verify the refactor passes existing quality gates (done incrementally for converted commands; final run pending once `complete-task` is migrated)

## Success Criteria
- [x] All converted command unit tests execute without invoking real child processes, Git commands, or filesystem writes
- [x] Converted commands no longer call `process.exit` or `console` directly from business logic; wrappers handle user IO and exit codes
- [x] `complete-task` matches the DI pattern and its success/error paths are fully covered by tests
- [x] Final `bun test` / lint / typecheck pass after all commands are converted
- [x] CLI behaviour remains consistent for end users (no changes to command names, flags, or outputs beyond improved error handling)

## Technical Approach (Revised)
1. Context module (`src/commands/context.ts`) created with `CommandDeps`, default adapters, `CommandResult`, and helper utilities.
2. Each command now exposes pure helpers (e.g., `runBacklog`, `showRevert`) returning `CommandResult`s; Commander wrappers (`createXCommand`) resolve default deps and handle IO/exit codes.
3. Shared test utilities (mock deps) are included in new command test suites to cover success/failure branches.
4. Remaining scope is to break down `complete-task` into injectable phases (validation, doc updates, git ops, GitHub/PR flow), return structured results, and add unit coverage. **(Completed)**
5. After `complete-task`, revisit CLI registration/`src/cli/index.ts` to ensure all commands use factory wrappers. **(Verified, no changes required)**
6. Run a comprehensive `bun test` plus lint/typecheck once all commands are converted. **(Completed)**

## Recent Progress
- Added `src/commands/context.ts` providing common DI infrastructure and helper utilities (with unit tests in `context.test.ts`).
- Refactored simple commands (`init`, `setup-commands`, `setup-templates`, `backlog`, `parse-logs`) to use the DI pattern; added dedicated tests for each.
- Converted mid-complexity commands (`statusline`, `prepare-completion`, `hook`, `git-session`) to DI style and wrote unit coverage for their core helpers.
- Refactored `create-task-from-issue` into small injectable steps and added focused tests.
- Verified `bun test` passes after each conversion (latest run includes all converted commands).
- Completed `complete-task` refactor to use the DI context, decomposed workflow helpers, and added focused unit tests plus wrapper smoke coverage.
- Updated supporting command modules/tests for new context typing adjustments; ensured lint/typecheck compatibility and reorganized imports across the suite.
- Validated repository with `bun run typecheck`, `bun run lint`, and `bun test` after the full refactor.

### Code Review and Production Quality (2025-09-16)
- Conducted comprehensive code review of PR #73 with detailed analysis of the DI refactor implementation
- Identified production quality improvements needed: shared test utilities, dependency mapping simplification, standardized mock patterns, and test file organization
- Approved PR #73 as high-quality refactoring that significantly improves testability and maintainability
- Task now focused on implementing production quality improvements before final merge

### PR Review Follow-up (2025-01-16)
- Successfully resolved merge conflicts with main branch that introduced CodeRabbit as alternative code review tool
- Fixed P1 regression identified by Codex: Added branch validation before `pushCurrentBranch()` to prevent pushing wrong branch
- Added test case `'skips push when not on task branch'` to prevent regression recurrence
- All 334 tests passing after fixes

## Current Focus
Working on production quality improvements identified during code review to bring the DI refactor to production-ready state.

## Production Quality Improvements (In Progress)
Based on code review, the following improvements are being made for production readiness:

### High Priority
- [ ] **Extract shared test utilities** - Multiple test files have duplicate mock creation functions that should be consolidated
- [ ] **Simplify dependency mapping** - Some commands like `complete-task` have unnecessary indirection with mapping functions

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Standardize mock patterns** - Inconsistent mocking approaches (some use `mock(() => {})`, others `mock(() => undefined)`)
- [ ] **Split long test files** - `complete-task.test.ts` is 365+ lines and should be split by functionality

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Add integration tests** - While unit coverage is comprehensive, critical paths need end-to-end validation
- [ ] **Document DI pattern** - Add guide for future contributors explaining the dependency injection architecture

## Next Steps
1. Complete high-priority production improvements
2. Address medium priority items for better maintainability
3. Add integration tests and documentation
4. Final review before merging
