# Clean Up Progress Log Noise and Backlog

**Purpose:** Remove unnecessary "Started" entries from progress log, clean up existing noise, and maintain only meaningful status changes to improve readability and value of the progress tracking system.

**Status:** planning
**Started:** 2025-09-10 14:31
**Task ID:** 019

## Requirements
- [ ] Remove code in `.claude/hooks/capture_plan.ts` (lines ~262-266) that creates "Started: Task X created from plan" entries
- [ ] Clean up all 16 existing "Started: Task X created from plan" entries from `.claude/progress_log.md`
- [ ] Keep all Completed, Abandoned, and other meaningful entries in progress log
- [ ] Fix missing "Started" entry for Task 010 by adding completed entry if needed
- [ ] Maintain chronological order and formatting in progress log
- [ ] Remove completed item "don't add task started entries to progress log, it's just noise" from `.claude/backlog.md`
- [ ] Review other backlog items for any that are completed or obsolete
- [ ] Ensure only meaningful status changes (Completed, Blocked, Failed) are logged going forward

## Success Criteria
- Progress log contains only meaningful status changes, no administrative noise
- All "Started" entries are removed while preserving actual progress entries
- Hook code no longer creates "Started" entries for new tasks
- Backlog is cleaned of completed items
- File sizes reduced and readability improved
- Task tracking remains consistent and functional

## Technical Approach
1. **Stop the noise at source:** Modify capture_plan.ts to remove the code creating "Started" entries
2. **Clean existing data:** Remove 16 "Started" entries from progress_log.md while preserving meaningful entries
3. **Maintain data integrity:** Ensure chronological order and proper formatting
4. **Clean backlog:** Remove completed items and review for obsolete entries

## Current Focus
Start with modifying the hook code in capture_plan.ts to prevent future noise, then clean up existing entries in progress_log.md

## Open Questions & Blockers
- Need to verify exact line numbers in capture_plan.ts for the code to remove
- Should confirm Task 010's status and whether it needs a completion entry
- Need to review all backlog items to identify any other completed/obsolete entries

## Next Steps
1. Examine `.claude/hooks/capture_plan.ts` to locate the code creating "Started" entries
2. Remove the problematic code section
3. Clean up existing "Started" entries from progress_log.md
4. Review and clean backlog.md
5. Test that new tasks don't create "Started" entries
