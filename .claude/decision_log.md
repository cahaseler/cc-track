# Decision Log

**Purpose:** Immutable record of significant decisions made throughout the project lifecycle. Captures context, rationale, and implications of key choices.

**Instructions:**
- Log decisions with notable impact on project direction, architecture, or implementation
- Include *why* the decision was made and alternatives considered
- Do **NOT** modify existing entries - append chronologically
- Format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - [Summary of Decision]` followed by details

## Log Entries

[2025-09-09 19:30] - Pivot from General Context Extraction to Error Pattern Learning
- **Context:** Initial pre_compact hook using regex parsing extracted nothing useful from transcripts
- **Decision:** Focus exclusively on extracting error patterns and their resolutions
- **Rationale:** Error patterns provide concrete, actionable learning that directly improves future performance
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - General context summarization: Too vague, loses specifics
  - Full transcript preservation: Too large, hits token limits
  - Manual annotation: Requires user intervention
- **Implications:** Pre-compact hook now builds knowledge base of mistakes to avoid
- **Reversibility:** Easy - could add additional extraction modules later

[2025-09-09 19:45] - Use SessionStart Hook for Post-Compaction Updates
- **Context:** Need to update task documentation after compaction but have no access to summary
- **Decision:** Use SessionStart hook with "compact" matcher to inject instructions to Claude
- **Rationale:** Instructions become part of Claude's context after reset, ensuring documentation updates
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Parse compaction summary: Not available in hook data
  - Store state externally: Complex state management required
  - Manual updates: Defeats automation purpose
- **Implications:** Claude automatically updates task files after each compaction
- **Reversibility:** Easy - hook can be disabled or modified
