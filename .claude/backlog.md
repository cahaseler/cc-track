# Backlog

**Purpose:** Capture ideas, bugs, and future improvements without disrupting current work flow.

**Instructions:**
- Use `/add-to-backlog "your idea"` to add items
- Each item should be 1-2 sentences max
- These are NOT active tasks - just ideas for future consideration
- Items can be converted to tasks later using planning mode

---

## Items

<!-- Items will be added below -->
- optional full github support with automatic issue creation for tasks, connection of issue branches to said issues, and PRs instead of merges during task completion.
- tutorial mode for cc-track. Possibly extra prompt content, possibly an entirely new 'output style'. Basically, when this is enabled, Claude has additional context on the intended cc-track workflow and nudges the user more explicitly with reminders of commands, using tasks, what the next step is, etc.
- packaging and distribution, installer, initial installation flow.
- [2025-09-10] revise review_stop hook to have a claude instance review recent chat messages for AI bullshit excuses like functional enough or not critical functionality when it's trying to avoid completing a task properly
- [2025-09-10] investigate supressing file change notifications to certain folders like logs to avoid noise injection into context.
