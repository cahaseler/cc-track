## Fix GitHub Issue Creation Not Working

### Problem Analysis
GitHub issue creation is implemented and enabled but not working due to a validation issue. The `isGitHubRepoConnected` check is incorrectly failing even though the repository IS connected to GitHub.

### Root Cause
The validation function `isGitHubRepoConnected` is using `gh repo view 2>/dev/null` but the error redirection might not be working correctly in all contexts, causing the validation to fail.

### Fix Plan

1. **Fix the GitHub validation check**
   - Update `isGitHubRepoConnected` in `src/lib/github-helpers.ts` to handle stderr properly
   - Instead of redirecting stderr in the command string, use execSync options
   - Add better error logging to understand why validation fails

2. **Test the fix**
   - Build the project
   - Test creating a task from planning mode to verify GitHub issue creation works

3. **Optional improvements**
   - Add retry logic for transient GitHub API failures
   - Better error messages when GitHub operations fail

This should restore GitHub issue creation functionality that's been failing silently.
