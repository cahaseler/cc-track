## Add Three Test Functions to capture-plan.test.ts

I'll add three new test functions to the capture-plan test file to provide more comprehensive testing of the plan capturing hook functionality:

### 1. **Test GitHub Integration Path**
Add a test in the `capturePlanHook` describe block that verifies the hook properly handles GitHub integration when enabled:
- Mock GitHub issue creation
- Verify issue-based branch naming
- Check that the task file includes GitHub issue reference

### 2. **Test Git Branching Configuration**
Add a test that verifies the hook respects git branching configuration:
- Test when git branching is disabled (should stay on current branch)
- Test when git branching is enabled (should create feature branch)
- Verify correct branch naming patterns

### 3. **Test Error Recovery and Logging**
Add a test that verifies proper error handling and recovery:
- Test behavior when task directory creation fails
- Test behavior when Claude SDK enrichment fails but fallback works
- Verify appropriate error logging and user messages

These tests will enhance coverage of:
- GitHub integration workflows
- Git branching configuration
- Error handling and recovery paths
- Dependency injection patterns

Each test will follow the established patterns in the file using proper mocks and dependency injection.
