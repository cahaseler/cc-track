# Test Capture Plan Hook Logging Fix

## Purpose
Verify that the capture_plan hook now logs properly after adding the missing config import.

## Simple Test Plan
1. Approve this plan to trigger the capture_plan hook
2. Check the logs immediately after approval to confirm logging is working
3. Look for new capture_plan entries in `.claude/logs/2025-09-10.jsonl`
4. Verify the hook logs the tool_response structure for future debugging

## Expected Results
- New capture_plan log entries should appear with timestamps around the approval time
- Should see "Hook triggered", "Plan was approved, creating task", and "Plan content" messages
- The tool_response structure should be captured for analysis
- This will complete the logging fix validation for Task 012

This is a minimal test to confirm our fix worked.
