## Plan to Complete Task 017: Clean Up All TypeScript and Biome Errors

### 1. Audit Autofix Changes
- Review git diff for all modified files to ensure no unintended changes
- Confirm all changes are formatting/import related only

### 2. Fix Remaining TypeScript Errors
- Remove unused HookOutput interface from stop_review.ts (line 19)
- Check for any other TypeScript errors across all files

### 3. Fix Biome Linting Issues
- Fix explicit any types by creating proper interfaces
- Fix switch block declarations (wrap in blocks when declaring variables)
- Apply code improvements (optional chaining, template literals, const vs let)
- Remove any remaining unused variables/imports

### 4. Update Configuration
- Change noUnusedVariables from "warn" to "error" in biome.json
- Change noNonNullAssertion from "warn" to "error"
- Explicitly set useNodejsImportProtocol as "error"

### 5. Final Validation
- Run `bun run check` to ensure zero errors
- Verify all linting rules are now errors, not warnings
- Commit the clean, fully linted codebase

The autofix tools worked correctly - my analysis was wrong. The project is in a stable state with only minor cleanup needed.
