## Plan: Add Backlog System to cc-pars

### Overview
Create a backlog system that allows quick capture of ideas and future tasks without disrupting current work flow.

### Components to Create

#### 1. Backlog File: `.claude/backlog.md`
```markdown
# Backlog

**Purpose:** Capture ideas, bugs, and future improvements without disrupting current work flow.

**Instructions:**
- Use `/add-to-backlog "your idea"` to add items
- Each item should be 1-2 sentences max
- These are NOT active tasks - just ideas for future consideration
- Items can be converted to tasks later using planning mode

---

## Items

<!-- Items will be added below -->
```

#### 2. Command File: `.claude/commands/add-to-backlog.md`
```markdown
---
shortname: add-to-backlog
---

# Add to Backlog

Adds an item to the project backlog for future consideration.

## Usage
`/add-to-backlog "Your idea or bug description"`

## Add Item
!`echo "- $(date +%Y-%m-%d): $1" >> .claude/backlog.md && echo "âœ… Added to backlog: $1"`
```

### Implementation Details

The command will:
1. Use bash to append a new bullet point to the backlog file
2. Include the date for reference
3. Confirm the addition with a success message
4. Work without disrupting any current task or workflow

### Benefits
- Quick capture of ideas during other work
- No context switching required
- Preserves ideas that might otherwise be lost
- Simple one-line additions
- Chronological tracking with dates
- Can review backlog when planning next tasks

### File Changes Summary
1. **Create**: `.claude/backlog.md` - The backlog file
2. **Create**: `.claude/commands/add-to-backlog.md` - Command to add items

### Notes
- Intentionally simple - just appends text, no complex parsing
- Uses bash echo with >> to append (safe, won't overwrite)
- The $1 in the command captures the user's parameter
- Date prefix helps track when ideas were captured
