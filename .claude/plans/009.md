## Plan: Fix add-to-backlog Command and Restore Lost Items

### Problem
The `/add-to-backlog` command is adding empty lines instead of the actual content. The `$ARGUMENTS` variable isn't being properly passed through to the bash command.

### Items That Need to Be Added
These items were attempted but only created empty lines:
1. optional full github support with automatic issue creation for tasks, connection of issue branches to said issues, and PRs instead of merges during task completion
2. preparation for push functionality. Possibly this is simply an optional part of task completion. Basically, cleanup with knip, lint, format, typecheck, etc, enforced by pre-push hooks
3. centralized logging. right now various hooks log to various places. having a centralized system to log all relevant hook, command, etc activity to .claude/logs/ would make things easier to manage and make code cleaner
4. tutorial mode for cc-pars. Possibly extra prompt content, possibly an entirely new 'output style'. Basically, when this is enabled, Claude has additional context on the intended cc-pars workflow and nudges the user more explicitly with reminders of commands, using tasks, what the next step is, etc
5. packaging and distribution, installer, initial installation flow

### Solution Approach

#### Option 1: Debug the $ARGUMENTS variable
- Test different variable names or escaping methods
- Check if it's a Claude Code specific issue with command arguments

#### Option 2: Use a different approach
- Instead of relying on bash command arguments, have the command write to a temp file
- Or use a different mechanism to capture the arguments

#### Option 3: Simplify to a script
- Create a dedicated script that the command calls
- Pass arguments to the script instead of inline bash

### Immediate Actions
1. First, manually add the 5 lost items to the backlog
2. Clean up the empty lines
3. Fix the command to properly capture arguments
4. Test the fixed command

### Proposed Fix for Command
Try using positional arguments (`$1`) or environment variables instead of `$ARGUMENTS`, or investigate if there's a different way to access command arguments in slash commands.
