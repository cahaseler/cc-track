# Investigate /complete-task PR Creation Failure

## Research Plan
Instead of assuming the cause, I need to examine the actual evidence:

1. **Review cc-track logs** to see what exactly happened during the failed /complete-task run
   - Look for GitHub helper logs around push operations
   - Check complete-task command logs for the sequence of operations
   - Identify where exactly the failure occurred

2. **Compare with successful runs** in this project to understand the difference
   - Review logs from successful complete-task operations on new branches
   - Identify any environmental or configuration differences

3. **Access the failing project** if needed to:
   - Compare git configuration between projects
   - Check GitHub CLI setup and authentication
   - Review the specific branch state when the failure occurred

4. **Analyze the root cause** based on actual data rather than assumptions
   - Determine if it's a git config issue, authentication problem, or logic bug
   - Understand why the same code works here but failed there

## Next Steps
- Examine the logs first to understand what actually happened
- Only then determine if there's a code fix needed or if it's a configuration issue
- Focus on the specific failure rather than general improvements to the push logic

This approach will give us the real story rather than guessing based on an error message.
