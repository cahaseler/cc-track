## Plan: Integrate Claude Code TypeScript SDK into cc-track

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept - Validate Pro Subscription Works

#### Step 1: Install the SDK
- Add `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` to package.json
- Run `bun install` to install the dependency

#### Step 2: Create a Simple Test Script
- Create `src/lib/claude-sdk-test.ts` with a minimal test:
  - Import the SDK's `query` function
  - Create a simple prompt (e.g., "What is 2+2?")
  - Use minimal options (just model selection)
  - Log the response to verify it works with Pro subscription

#### Step 3: Run and Validate
- Execute the test script with `bun run`
- Confirm it uses the existing Pro subscription (no API key required)
- Verify we get a proper response without authentication errors

### Phase 2: Create SDK Wrapper (After POC Success)

#### Step 4: Build a Clean Abstraction
- Create `src/lib/claude-sdk.ts` with a wrapper class
- Implement methods for our current use cases:
  - `generateCommitMessage()`
  - `generateBranchName()` 
  - `reviewCode()`
  - `enrichTask()`
  - `extractPatterns()`

#### Step 5: Migrate Existing CLI Calls
- Replace CLI calls in GitHelpers with SDK calls
- Update hooks to use the new SDK wrapper
- Ensure all functionality works identically

### Phase 3: Explore Advanced Capabilities (Future)

#### Step 6: Experiment with Controlled Agents
- Create a proof-of-concept validation agent with restricted permissions
- Test file reading without writing capabilities
- Explore multi-turn conversations for review workflows

### Success Criteria for Phase 1:
- ✅ SDK installed successfully
- ✅ Test script runs without authentication errors
- ✅ Response received using Pro subscription (not API key)
- ✅ No hooks triggered (no /tmp hack needed)

### What We're NOT Doing Yet:
- Not refactoring existing code until POC proves successful
- Not building complex agents until basic functionality confirmed
- Not removing CLI dependency (SDK still needs it installed)
