## Plan: Clean Up Progress Log Noise and Backlog

### Part 1: Stop Creating "Started" Entries
**Location:** `.claude/hooks/capture_plan.ts` (line ~262-266)
- Remove the code that appends "Started: Task X created from plan" entries to progress_log.md
- These entries add no value since task creation is already tracked in the task files themselves
- Keep only meaningful status changes (Completed, Blocked, Failed)

### Part 2: Clean Up Existing Progress Log
**File:** `.claude/progress_log.md`
- Remove all 16 "Started: Task X created from plan" entries
- Keep all Completed, Abandoned, and other meaningful entries
- Fix missing "Started" entry for Task 010 by adding completed entry if missing
- Maintain chronological order and formatting

### Part 3: Clean Up Backlog
**File:** `.claude/backlog.md`
- Remove the completed item: "don't add task started entries to progress log, it's just noise"
- Review other items for any that are already completed or obsolete
- Keep the backlog focused on actual future work

### Benefits:
- Progress log becomes more valuable - only shows actual progress, not administrative noise
- Reduces file size and improves readability
- Makes it easier to see what actually got completed
- Aligns with the principle that task files themselves track task existence

### Changes Summary:
1. Modify `capture_plan.ts` to stop creating "Started" entries
2. Clean up 16 existing "Started" entries from progress_log.md
3. Remove completed item from backlog.md
4. Ensure consistency in remaining entries
