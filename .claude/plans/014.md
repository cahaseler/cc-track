# Test Debug Logging in Capture Plan Hook

## Purpose
Test the debug logging we just added to capture_plan hook to diagnose why centralized logging fails.

## Simple Test Plan
1. Approve this plan to trigger the capture_plan hook with debug logging
2. Check `/tmp/capture_plan_debug.log` for detailed execution trace
3. Check centralized logs to see if logging now works
4. Analyze debug output to identify the root cause of logger failure

## Expected Debug Output
The debug log should show:
- Hook initialization and logger creation
- Input parsing and approval detection
- Each logger method call attempt
- Any errors or failures in the logging process

This will finally reveal why capture_plan hook works functionally but fails to log centrally.
