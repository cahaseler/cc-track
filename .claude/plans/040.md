## Fix statusline to show today's cost correctly

The statusline is showing "Unknown" instead of the daily cost because of a timezone issue. The code uses `new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]` which returns the UTC date (2025-09-13), but it's still September 12 in EDT timezone.

### The fix:
1. Update `getTodaysCost` in `src/commands/statusline.ts` to use local date instead of UTC
2. Change from `new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]` to a method that gets the local date
3. Test that the statusline now shows the correct daily cost

This is a simple one-line fix to ensure we're looking up the correct date in the ccusage data.
