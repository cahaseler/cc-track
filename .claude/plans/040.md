## Plan to Remove Commit Reminder Logic from Stop Hook

I'll remove the logic that adds the "You have made X commits without an active task. Consider using planning mode..." reminder from the stop-review hook.

### Changes needed:

1. **In `src/hooks/stop-review.ts`:**
   - Remove the `checkRecentNonTaskCommits()` method (lines 490-518)
   - Remove the `nonTaskSuggestion` variable and logic (lines 702-718)
   - Update `generateStopOutput()` to remove the `nonTaskSuggestion` parameter
   - Remove all places where `nonTaskSuggestion` is appended to messages

2. **In `src/hooks/stop-review.test.ts`:**
   - Remove the test assertion that checks the message doesn't contain "I notice you've made"

### Summary:
This will restore the stop hook to its previous behavior where it only provides review feedback without the additional reminder about creating tasks when multiple non-task commits are made.
