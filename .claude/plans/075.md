## Fix setup-cc-track command bash execution for non-git repos

### Problem
The setup-cc-track.md command file has bash commands that fail when not in a git repo:
- `!\`git status 2>&1\`` - fails with non-zero exit code
- `!\`gh auth status 2>&1\`` - also fails with non-zero exit code

Even though we redirect stderr to stdout, the non-zero exit code causes the slash command to crash.

### Solution
Wrap these commands with `|| true` or `|| echo` to always return success:

1. Change line 66 in src/commands/init.ts from:
   ```
   !\`git status 2>&1\`
   ```
   to:
   ```
   !\`git status 2>&1 || echo "Not a git repository"\`
   ```

2. Change line 67 from:
   ```
   !\`gh auth status 2>&1\`  
   ```
   to:
   ```
   !\`gh auth status 2>&1 || echo "GitHub CLI not authenticated or not installed"\`
   ```

This way the commands always succeed but provide helpful output about the actual state, allowing the setup process to continue and handle the non-git case gracefully as designed.
