## Fix prepare-completion Command Path Issue

The problem is a mismatch between the embedded command template and what's needed for other projects. The embedded template has `cc-track prepare-completion` but it should be `npx cc-track prepare-completion` to work when installed via npm.

### Plan:
1. Update the embedded command template in `src/lib/embedded-resources.ts` to use `npx cc-track prepare-completion`
2. Similarly update other command templates to use `npx cc-track` for consistency
3. Rebuild the binary so the fix is included in the distributed version

This will ensure that when users run `/prepare-completion` in their projects, it uses `npx` which will find the installed cc-track package.
