## Fix Prepare-Completion Command Error Handling

### Problem
The `/prepare-completion` slash command fails with a hard error when there are validation issues (linting errors, TypeScript errors, etc.) instead of passing the feedback to Claude. This happens because the command exits with code 1 when validation fails, which the bash command interprets as a failure.

### Solution
Change the prepare-completion command to always exit with code 0 (success), regardless of validation results. The command already outputs detailed feedback about what needs to be fixed - we just need Claude to see that output instead of getting a "Bash command failed" error.

### Implementation
1. Modify `src/commands/prepare-completion.ts`:
   - Line 151: Change `process.exit(validationPassed ? 0 : 1)` to `process.exit(0)`
   - Keep all the detailed output about validation issues
   - The command will still show what needs to be fixed, but won't cause a bash error

2. Rebuild the binary:
   - Run `bun run build` to compile the updated command

### Result
- Claude will see the validation feedback and can fix the issues
- No more "Bash command failed" errors blocking the workflow
- The command still provides all the same information about what needs to be fixed
