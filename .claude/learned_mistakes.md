# Learned Mistakes

**Purpose:** Document errors encountered and their correct resolutions to avoid repeating mistakes

**Instructions:**
- This file is automatically updated by the pre_compact hook
- Each entry shows an error pattern and the correct solution
- Review these before attempting similar operations

## Error Patterns

*(Entries will be added here by the pre_compact hook)*
### Session: 2025-09-09 19:21
- When encountering "File has not been read yet" errors during Edit operations, always use the Read tool first to load the file into context before attempting edits
- After updating Claude CLI with `claude update`, verify the update succeeded with `claude --version` before proceeding with dependent operations
- When analyzing JSONL transcript files, use jq with proper type checking: `select(.toolUseResult and (.toolUseResult | type == "object"))` to avoid parsing errors on mixed data types
- For extracting error messages from tool results, check if toolUseResult is a string type first with `(.toolUseResult | type == "string")` before attempting string operations
- When grep operations are blocked by user hooks, consider that the pattern or command may trigger security filters - simplify the search or use different filtering approaches
- File counting operations like `grep -c` are more reliable than complex jq parsing when determining the number of matching entries in JSONL files
- When working with Claude CLI enrichment features, always implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms since CLI operations can fail silently
