  Details: Implemented two-phase task completion workflow separating validation/preparation from mechanical completion
  Files: src/lib/validation.ts (new), src/commands/prepare-completion.ts, src/commands/complete-task.ts, .claude/commands/prepare-completion.md, .claude/commands/complete-task.md
  Key Achievement: Clean separation of concerns with prepare-completion providing dynamic instructions and complete-task handling mechanical operations. Validation logic refactored to library function for better performance. PR duplicate prevention and automatic branch management working correctly.

[2025-09-12 15:15] - Completed: Task 034 - Fix GitHub Issue Creation Not Working
  Details: Attempted to fix GitHub issue creation by improving validation and command escaping
  Files: src/lib/github-helpers.ts (isGitHubRepoConnected and createGitHubIssue functions updated)
  Key Achievement: The fixes made were good improvements but didn't solve the actual problem. The real issue was unrequested label functionality trying to add 'task' and 'cc-track' labels that don't exist in user repos. This was only discovered and fixed later by removing all label-related code.

[2025-09-12 16:50] - Completed: Task 035 - Fix TypeScript Validation Hook Issue
  Details: Resolved false positive TypeScript errors by implementing project-wide validation with file-specific filtering
  Files: src/hooks/edit-validation.ts, src/hooks/edit-validation.test.ts

  Details: Fixed the /prepare-completion slash command to properly pass validation feedback to Claude
  Files: src/commands/prepare-completion.ts

[2025-09-12 21:30] - Completed: Task 037 - Fix GitHub Branch Linking Issue
  Details: Fixed backwards logic in capture-plan hook that prevented GitHub issues from being properly linked to branches
  Files: src/hooks/capture-plan.ts, src/hooks/capture-plan.test.ts
  Key Achievement: Refactored handleGitHubIntegration to return issue object, reordered operations to create issues before branches, and fixed condition logic. Now properly uses `gh issue develop` when configured, ensuring PRs automatically link to their issues.

[2025-09-12 22:10] - Completed: Task 038 - Remove Unused Standalone Function Exports
  Details: Cleaned up ~20 unused standalone function exports to clarify class-based architecture pattern
  Files: src/lib/github-helpers.ts, src/lib/git-helpers.ts, src/lib/claude-md.ts, src/hooks/edit-validation.ts, knip.json
  Key Achievement: Reduced Knip warnings from 25+ to just 2, removed redundant backward compatibility exports that were never used, made class-based pattern with dependency injection the clear primary approach. Kept only 6 standalone functions that are actually imported.

[2025-09-12 19:50] - Completed: Task 039 - Integrate Claude Code TypeScript SDK into cc-track
  Details: Successfully replaced all CLI-based Claude interactions with the official TypeScript SDK

  Key Achievement: SDK integration eliminates temp files, subprocess overhead, and the /tmp hack. Critical fix: removed hardcoded outdated model versions (claude-3-5-*) and replaced with generic names ('haiku', 'sonnet', 'opus') for automatic latest versions. All 245 tests passing with proper mocking.

[2025-09-13 19:00] - Completed: Task 043 - Integrate DiffSummary into Stop-Review Hook for Token Reduction
  Details: Successfully integrated DiffSummary tool to compress large git diffs before sending to Sonnet, achieving ~80% token reduction
  Files: src/hooks/stop-review.ts, src/hooks/stop-review.test.ts, src/lib/diff-summary.ts
  Key Achievement: Two-stage review process using Haiku for compression ($0.25/M tokens) then Sonnet for deviation detection ($3/M tokens). Smart diff splitting at file boundaries, parallel processing with batching, graceful fallback to truncated original on failure. All 37 stop-review tests passing.

[2025-09-13 23:45] - Completed: Task 044 - Task File Edit Validation Enhancement
  Details: Created PreToolUse hook that validates edits to task files using Claude SDK, preventing premature completion claims
  Files: src/hooks/task-validation.ts (new), src/hooks/task-validation.test.ts (new), src/commands/hook.ts, src/types.ts, .claude/settings.json, .claude/track.config.json
  Key Achievement: Intelligent validation using Sonnet model to detect and block status changes to "completed" and weasel words claiming completion while admitting failures. Robust JSON parsing handles various response formats. All 15 tests passing.
