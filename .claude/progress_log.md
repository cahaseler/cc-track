**Purpose:** Chronological, granular log of tasks initiated, delegated, and completed. Tracks step-by-step execution of work.

**Instructions:**
- Log entries for task status changes (Started, Blocked, Completed)
- Include timestamps for all entries
- Do **NOT** modify existing entries - append chronologically
- Format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - [Status]: [Task Summary]`

### Status Types
- **Started:** Task initiated
- **Completed:** Task finished successfully
- **Blocked:** Task cannot proceed (include reason)
- **Failed:** Task failed (include error)
- **Reviewed:** Task output reviewed/validated
- **Revised:** Task output modified based on feedback
