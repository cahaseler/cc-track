## Project Vision & Goals

**cc-track (Task Review And Context Keeper)** is a comprehensive context management and workflow optimization system for Claude Code that keeps your vibe coding on track.

### Vision
Solve the fundamental problem of context loss in Claude Code sessions through intelligent preservation, task tracking, and quality assurance.

### Goals
- Preserve critical context through compaction cycles
- Enforce completion of tasks rather than "close enough" declarations
- Provide continuous awareness of task status and context usage
- Guide development through planning and validation

## Target Audience

**Primary Users:** Software developers using Claude Code for:
- Complex multi-file projects
- Long-running development sessions
- Projects requiring consistent patterns and conventions
- Teams needing reproducible AI-assisted workflows

**User Needs:**
- Avoid re-explaining project context after compaction
- Track multiple tasks and their status
- Ensure AI follows established patterns
- Validate work meets requirements before declaring complete

## Core Features & Functionality

### Context Management
- Dynamic CLAUDE.md with file imports
- Automatic context extraction before compaction
- Persistent storage of project patterns and decisions
- Smart categorization (persistent/cached/dynamic)

### Task Tracking
- Plan capture from planning mode
- Active task management with requirements
- Progress logging and decision tracking
- Task status visibility in status line

### Quality Assurance
- Real-time edit validation for TypeScript files (PostToolUse hook)
- Automated review of changes at stop points
- Error pattern learning and documentation
- Task completion validation with smart automation

### Developer Experience
- Custom two-line status line with cost tiers and API timer
- Train-themed visual feedback (üöÖ üõ§Ô∏è) and cost emojis (ü™ô‚Üíü§ë)
- Configurable features via track.config.json
- One-command initialization (`/init-track`)
- Safe file handling with backups and validation

## Non-Goals / Out of Scope

- Strict TDD enforcement (offers guidance, not enforcement)
- Replacing Claude Code's native features
- Managing multiple Claude Code instances
- Primary version control operations (supports optional git branching)
- External API integrations (except ccusage)

## Technical Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Runtime:** Bun
- **Dependencies:** ccusage (for token tracking)
- **Integration:** Claude Code hooks system
- **File Format:** Markdown for context, JSON for config
- **Shell:** Bash for status line and simple hooks
