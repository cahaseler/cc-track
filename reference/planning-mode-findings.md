# Planning Mode Research Findings

## How to Enter/Exit Planning Mode

### Manual Entry
- **Enter**: Press `Shift+Tab` twice quickly
- **Exit**: Press `Shift+Tab` again
- Most terminals require two quick presses

### Programmatic Entry
- No direct CLI flag yet (feature request exists for `--plan` or `--mode plan`)
- Once in session, use `Shift+Tab` twice

### Exit via Tool
- Use `ExitPlanMode` tool when ready to present plan
- Shows plan to user for approval
- Prompts user to exit plan mode

## What Planning Mode Does

### Capabilities
- **Read-only mode** - Cannot create, modify, or delete files
- Can read files and search code
- Can understand codebase structure
- Can create comprehensive plans
- Can research and analyze

### Workflow
1. Enter plan mode (Shift+Tab twice)
2. Research and analyze codebase
3. Create implementation plan
4. Present plan via ExitPlanMode tool
5. Wait for user approval
6. Exit to execution mode

## Model Strategy

### Opus Plan Mode
- Access via `/model` command, option 4:
  - "Use Opus 4.1 in plan mode, Sonnet 4 otherwise"
- Benefits:
  - Opus for planning (smarter)
  - Sonnet for execution (cheaper)
  - More efficient token usage
  - Faster performance

## Best Practices

### When to Use
- Complex multi-step tasks
- Tasks requiring careful planning
- When you want to review before execution
- Exploring unfamiliar codebases

### Workflow Pattern
1. Iterate in plan mode until happy
2. Exit with Shift+Tab twice
3. Ask Claude to implement with auto-edits
4. Minimal intervention needed

### Important Notes
- NO file changes in plan mode
- Plans can be revised based on feedback
- Extra confirmation when exiting
- Fast and token-efficient
