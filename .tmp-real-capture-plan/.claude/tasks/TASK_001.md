# Implement Feature X End-to-End with Tests

**Purpose:** Implement a complete Feature X solution including all necessary components, functionality, and comprehensive test coverage

**Status:** planning
**Started:** 2025-09-12
**Task ID:** 001

## Requirements
- [ ] Define Feature X specifications and scope
- [ ] Design system architecture for Feature X
- [ ] Implement core Feature X functionality
- [ ] Create user interface components for Feature X
- [ ] Add data persistence layer for Feature X
- [ ] Implement API endpoints for Feature X
- [ ] Write unit tests for all components
- [ ] Write integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- [ ] Add error handling and validation
- [ ] Document Feature X usage and API
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Ensure code follows project conventions

## Success Criteria
- Feature X is fully functional and meets all specified requirements
- All unit and integration tests pass
- Code coverage meets project standards
- Feature X integrates seamlessly with existing system
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Technical Approach
- Follow established project patterns and conventions
- Implement test-driven development approach
- Use existing libraries and frameworks where appropriate
- Ensure proper separation of concerns
- Follow project's error handling patterns

## Current Focus
Define the specific scope and requirements for Feature X before beginning implementation

## Open Questions & Blockers
- What exactly is "Feature X"? Need specific feature definition and requirements
- What are the acceptance criteria for this feature?
- Are there any existing similar features to reference?
- What are the performance requirements?
- Are there any external dependencies or integrations needed?

## Next Steps
- Clarify Feature X specifications with stakeholder
- Research existing codebase for similar patterns
- Create detailed technical design document
- Set up development environment if needed
- Begin implementation following TDD approach
