# TASK_027 — Code Review (2025-09-11 20:17 UTC)

## Summary
- Branch: `feature/semantic-release-setup-027`
- Scope: Add semantic-release + GitHub Actions release pipeline, migrate autogenerated commit messages to conventional commits, and align hooks/commands/tests with the new format.
- Verdict: Implementation substantially meets the task spec. Core workflows remain intact. Two concrete issues identified (see Required Fixes), plus a few optional improvements.

## Spec Alignment
- Task Spec: [.claude/tasks/TASK_027.md](../.claude/tasks/TASK_027.md)
- Dependencies & Config:
  - `semantic-release` and related plugins added in `package.json` ✔
  - `.releaserc.json` includes commit analysis, changelog, exec prepare (build), GitHub asset upload, and git commit of CHANGELOG/package.json ✔
  - Cross‑platform build scripts present for Linux/Windows ✔
  - GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers on `master` and `main` ✔
- Conventional commits:
  - `GitHelpers.generateCommitMessage()` produces conventional commit messages ✔
  - `complete-task` squashes into `feat:` and uses `docs:` for final docs ✔
  - `stop-review` uses `wip:`/`docs:` depending on context ✔
  - `git-session` recognizes both `[wip]` and `wip:` ✔
- Success Criteria:
  - Auto versioning/changelog and release asset uploads configured ✔ (validation to occur on CI run)
  - Cross‑platform binaries built and attached to releases ✔
  - Commit generation migrated to conventional format ✔
  - Workflow triggers present on `master`/`main` ✔
  - Commit enforcement tooling (commitlint/husky) not added (optional) ◻

## Behavioral Diffs
- Auto‑commit style:
  - `stop-review`: switches from `[wip]` to `wip:` for work commits and uses `docs:` for documentation‑only changes.
  - `complete-task`: squashes to `feat: complete TASK_XXX - Title`; final docs use `docs:`.
  - `git-session`: treats both `[wip]` and `wip:` as WIP for safety.
- Review filtering:
  - `stop-review` filters `.md`/docs diffs from review scope and treats doc‑only diffs as on‑track with `docs:` commit.
- Release process: semantic‑release compiles binaries and uploads assets during GitHub release (new behavior; no user‑visible CLI changes).

## Tests & Coverage
- Tests present across `src/lib`, `src/hooks`, and `src/commands` (252 `test()` occurrences detected).
- `stop-review.test.ts` thoroughly covers repo detection, diff filtering, large diffs, Claude JSON/timeout handling, decision logic, and commit behavior.
- We did not execute the test suite locally due to read‑only sandbox; see Verified Commands for how to validate.

## Risks
- Release branch targeting mismatch:
  - `.releaserc.json` releases only on `master` (branches: ["master"]).
  - The GitHub Action triggers on both `master` and `main`. Pushing to `main` runs the job but semantic‑release no‑ops (confusing logs).
- Absolute binary path in `.claude/settings.json`:
  - Uses `/home/ubuntu/projects/cc-pars/dist/cc-track`; fragile on other machines/paths.
- Config description drift:
  - `.claude/track.config.json` still says "auto‑commits with [wip]" while code now prefers `wip:`; minor docs mismatch.
- Cross‑compiling Windows binary on Linux:
  - Supported by Bun; occasionally triggers AV false positives or runner differences. Current workflow compiles both binaries on a single Linux runner (acceptable).
- Redundant config access:
  - `complete-task` reads `track.config.json` directly instead of using `src/lib/config.ts`, which can lead to drift.

## Required Fixes
1) `complete-task` branch workflow flag lookup
   - File: `src/commands/complete-task.ts`
   - Issue: Code checks `config.hooks?.git_branching?.enabled` but `git_branching` lives under `features` per `.claude/track.config.json`.
   - Impact: Traditional local merge path may never trigger when GitHub integration is disabled.
   - Fix: Change to `config.features?.git_branching?.enabled`.

2) Align release branch configuration
   - Decide on canonical default branch (`master` vs `main`).
   - If default is `master`, consider removing `main` from the workflow trigger; if default is `main`, change `.releaserc.json` to `branches: ["main"]`.

## Optional Improvements
- Centralize config reads:
  - Use `getConfig()` from `src/lib/config.ts` in `complete-task` to avoid duplication and drift.
- Conventional commit enforcement:
  - Add `commitlint`/`husky` to enforce formatting locally (not required for CI release).
- Update config descriptions:
  - Reflect `wip:` usage in `.claude/track.config.json` description for `stop_review`.
- Document differences:
  - Add/refresh a small "differences" note explaining the conventional commit change and WIP detection supporting both `[wip]` and `wip:`.
- CI matrix (optional):
  - Build targets in a matrix for clarity/parallelism (current single‑runner approach is fine).

## Verified Commands
These validate the work locally (not executed here due to sandbox):

```
# Lint and typecheck
bun run check

# Run tests
bun test

# Build cross‑platform binaries
bun run build:cross-platform
ls -la dist/cc-track-linux dist/cc-track-windows.exe

# Dry‑run semantic‑release locally
bunx semantic-release --dry-run

# Confirm diff scope (current branch vs master)
git merge-base master HEAD | xargs -I{} git diff --name-status {}..HEAD
```

## References
- Task: `.claude/tasks/TASK_027.md`
- Changed files (vs master):
  - `.releaserc.json`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `package.json`
  - `src/hooks/stop-review.ts` (+ tests), `src/lib/git-helpers.ts`, `src/commands/complete-task.ts`, `src/commands/git-session.ts`
  - `.claude/system_patterns.md` (release/commit conventions note)
