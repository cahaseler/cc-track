**Summary**
- Task 026 refactors cc-track into a Commander.js-based CLI with modular commands and pure-function hooks, adds tests across hooks/libs/commands, and ships a compiled binary at `dist/cc-track`. Overall architecture is solid (DI-friendly, centralized logging, single hook entry), but I found several correctness and integration issues that would block “production-ready” status without fixes.

**Spec Alignment**
- Source of truth: `.claude/tasks/TASK_026.md` (Refactor cc-track to CLI Tool Architecture with Tests)
- Key claims: CLI entry and commands implemented, hooks converted to pure functions, tests with >90% coverage, compiled binary in use via settings, parity preserved, and docs updated for deltas.
- High-level alignment: The CLI architecture, hook dispatcher, DI-oriented libs, and compiled binary are present and mostly aligned. However, several gaps contradict “ready” status and the coverage/type-safety assertions.

**Behavioral Diffs**
- Hook dispatcher parity
  - New: `src/commands/hook.ts` centralizes stdin/stdout once and dispatches by `--type`. It writes JSON and exits non‑zero on errors or when blocking. Good.
  - Issue: Templates call `cc-track hook` without a `--type`, so nothing dispatches. This breaks hook execution in practice (see Required Fixes).
- Edit Validation behavior
  - Original `.claude/hooks/edit_validation.ts` annotated issues non‑blocking via `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` and exited 0.
  - New `src/hooks/edit-validation.ts` blocks on failures with `{ decision: 'block', reason }`, adds timeout handling and skips new files. This delta is documented in `docs/hook_functionality_differences_codex.md` and seems intentional and reasonable.
- Stop Review behavior
  - Original and refactor both implement a SessionReviewer class, filter docs out of diffs, and auto‑commit with `[wip]` messages. The refactor adds an early diff-size guard and clearer error/fallback handling. Good.
- Post Compact behavior
  - Parity looks good: both read imports from `CLAUDE.md`, assemble context, and return instructions; refactor returns both `systemMessage` and `hookSpecificOutput`.
- Git Session utilities
  - Code: New `src/commands/git-session.ts` exposes `show-revert`, `squash`, `show-wip`, `diff`, `prepare-push` subcommands (parity with `.claude/scripts/git-session.ts`).
  - Docs: `docs/command_functionality_differences_codex.md` still says the refactor does not expose equivalents. This doc is outdated relative to the code.
- Complete Task command
  - New `src/commands/complete-task.ts` updates task + CLAUDE.md + no_active_task.md, runs TS/Biome/Knip (configurable via `.claude/track.config.json`), and performs safe squash, plus GitHub PR push path. Behavior matches spec claims. Good.

**Tests & Coverage**
- Presence: Many tests exist for hooks (`src/hooks/*.test.ts`), libs (`src/lib/*.test.ts`), and CLI commands (`src/commands/*.test.ts`).
- Immediate failing mismatch
  - `src/commands/hook.test.ts` expects the `--type` option description to be exactly `"hook type to execute"`, but `src/commands/hook.ts` uses a longer description including the allowed types. This test will fail.
- Type-checking gap (critical)
  - `tsconfig.json` only includes `.claude/**` and `scripts/**`. The entire `src/**` tree is excluded from `tsc` checks. This undermines the spec claim that “TypeScript compliance” is ensured.
  - Example fallout: `HookOutput` in `src/types.ts` does not define `decision` or `reason`, yet several modules return these fields and reference them (e.g., `edit-validation`, `hook` dispatcher). Type safety is not enforced.
- Coverage claim (>90%) cannot be verified here. No coverage tooling is configured, and we did not run tests. The breadth of tests looks decent, but please run locally to confirm (see Verified Commands).

**Risks**
- Hooks not executing due to dispatcher usage
  - `templates/settings.json` invokes `/dist/cc-track hook` for PostToolUse/PreCompact/SessionStart but never passes `--type`. With `src/commands/hook.ts` requiring `--type`, hooks will not be dispatched, breaking core functionality.
- Status line script path mismatch
  - Template points to `.claude/scripts/statusline.sh`, but the initializer copies `statusline.sh` to `.claude/statusline.sh`. Statusline will fail unless corrected.
- Missing template: `track.config.json`
  - `init` tries to copy `templates/track.config.json`, but no such file exists in `templates/`. New projects won’t get a config unless created manually; code falls back to defaults.
- Stop Review hook likely uninvoked
  - Template settings include PostToolUse, PreCompact, and SessionStart/compact, but no SessionStop or equivalent that would trigger the stop-review flow.
- Type-safety not enforced for `src/**`
  - The lack of `src/**` in `tsconfig` means type regressions can creep in unnoticed; the `HookOutput` shape mismatch is a prime example.
- Docs drift
  - `docs/command_functionality_differences_codex.md` still claims the CLI does not expose git-session utilities; code does.
- Portability concerns
  - `.claude/commands/*.md` hardcode an absolute path to the compiled binary (`/home/ubuntu/projects/cc-pars/dist/cc-track`). This will break if used from other projects/machines without adjustment.

**Required Fixes**
1) Hook dispatcher usage in settings
   - Update `templates/settings.json` commands to include explicit hook types:
     - PostToolUse/ExitPlanMode → `cc-track hook --type capture-plan`
     - PostToolUse/Edit|Write|MultiEdit → `cc-track hook --type edit-validation`
     - PreCompact → `cc-track hook --type pre-compact`
     - SessionStart (source=compact) → `cc-track hook --type post-compact`
     - Add SessionStop (or equivalent) to invoke `cc-track hook --type stop-review` if that’s the intended trigger.
2) Statusline path
   - Either copy `statusline.sh` to `.claude/scripts/` in `init`, or change the template to `.claude/statusline.sh` to match where `init` writes it.
3) Provide `templates/track.config.json`
   - Add a default config template matching the structure expected by `src/lib/config.ts` and used by commands.
4) TypeScript coverage for `src/**`
   - Update `tsconfig.json` `include` globs to include `src/**`. Fix type mismatches:
     - Extend `HookOutput` in `src/types.ts` with optional `decision` and `reason` fields used by hooks and the dispatcher.
5) Fix the failing CLI test
   - Align `src/commands/hook.ts` option description with `hook.test.ts` or adjust the test to accept the full description.
6) Docs parity
   - Update `docs/command_functionality_differences_codex.md` to reflect that `git-session` subcommands are now present in the CLI.
7) Verify stop-review wiring
   - Ensure settings actually invoke the stop-review hook at the correct lifecycle event. Otherwise, the improved logic will never run.
8) Absolute binary paths in slash commands
   - Consider using a relative path or an environment-resolved binary name (`cc-track`) to improve portability across machines.

**Optional Improvements**
- Hook auto-detection
  - Enhance `hook` to infer the hook type from `hook_event_name` and context when `--type` is omitted. This would reduce duplication in settings and prevent misconfiguration.
- Exit code compatibility note
  - Document the new exit code behavior (2 for block) and confirm the Claude Code runtime ignores exit codes (consumes JSON only), to avoid surprises.
- Tests for `init`
  - Add tests that run `init` in a temp workspace and assert file locations, ensuring the statusline path and settings wiring don’t regress.

**Verified Commands**
- Build: `bun run build` (produces `dist/cc-track`).
- Lint/Typecheck: `bun run check` (note: currently won’t typecheck `src/**`; fix tsconfig first).
- Tests: `bun test` (to confirm mismatches like `hook` option description and overall pass rate).
- Manual smoke:
  - `dist/cc-track -h`
  - `dist/cc-track hook -h`
  - `dist/cc-track git-session -h`
  - Exercise `complete-task --no-squash --no-branch` on a scratch repo with a dummy `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/`.
