**Summary**
- Task 026 refactors cc-track into a Commander.js-based CLI with modular commands, pure-function hooks, and a compiled binary. The overall architecture (DI-friendly libs, centralized logging, single stdin/stdout hook dispatcher) is sound and aligns with modern CLI patterns. Parity with the original .claude hooks is largely maintained. A few portability/config gaps remain that should be addressed before declaring this production-ready.

**Spec Alignment**
- Source: `.claude/tasks/TASK_026.md` (Refactor cc-track to CLI Tool Architecture with Tests)
- Implemented items observed:
  - CLI entry at `src/cli/index.ts` with subcommands: `hook`, `init`, `backlog`, `complete-task`, `git-session`, `statusline`.
  - Hooks converted to pure functions under `src/hooks/**` with DI; dispatcher at `src/commands/hook.ts` reads stdin once and routes by input (no `--type`).
  - Tests present across hooks, libs, and commands under `src/**.test.ts`.
  - Compiled binary at `dist/cc-track`; `.claude/settings.json` and templates point to the binary.
  - Backward compatibility: JSON I/O preserved; `Stop` hook wired; git-session utilities provided via CLI.
- Not verified in this environment: test pass rate and coverage (>90%) due to execution constraints. Static review indicates breadth of testing.

**Behavioral Diffs**
- Hook dispatcher
  - Original: individual stdin/stdout scripts per hook.
  - New: `src/commands/hook.ts` reads stdin once and infers hook from `hook_event_name`/`tool_name`. Settings invoke `cc-track hook` with no `--type`. This removes config duplication and matches the spec’s post-completion improvement note.
- Edit validation
  - Original `.claude/hooks/edit_validation.ts`: non-blocking; emits `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` with issues and exits 0.
  - New `src/hooks/edit-validation.ts`: can block with `{ decision: 'block', reason }` on TS/Biome failures and handles timeouts explicitly. This is an intentional UX change; JSON remains compatible.
- Post-compaction
  - Original: injects full instructions into `systemMessage`.
  - New: returns a concise `systemMessage` summary for the user and full instructions via `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`. Net improvement; JSON contract preserved.
- Stop review
  - Parity maintained with improvements: diff filtering, safer fallbacks, explicit handling for oversized diffs resulting in `[wip] ... review skipped` commits. Auto-commit logic and suggestion about non-task commits preserved.
- Capture plan
  - Parity with enhancements: DI for git/GitHub helpers, branching/issue creation when enabled, Claude enrichment through temp file prompts, CLAUDE.md update. Maintains existing JSON semantics.
- Git-session utilities
  - Newly exposed via CLI: `show-revert`, `squash`, `show-wip`, `diff`, `prepare-push`. Matches spec’s “restored functionality”.

**Tests & Coverage**
- Presence: Extensive test files across `src/hooks`, `src/lib`, and `src/commands`.
- Type safety: `tsconfig.json` includes `src/**/*.ts` (good) and excludes test files; strict options enabled.
- Execution not performed here (read-only, restricted). Locally run to validate:
  - `bun run check` (typecheck + lint)
  - `bun test`
  - Confirm binary runs: `dist/cc-track -h`

**Risks**
- Absolute binary paths in settings/templates
  - `templates/settings*.json` and `.claude/settings.json` hardcode `/home/ubuntu/projects/cc-pars/dist/cc-track`. This breaks portability across machines/projects.
- Missing `templates/track.config.json`
  - `src/commands/init.ts` copies `templates/track.config.json`, but no such file exists in `templates/`. Init will log “Template not found” and proceed with defaults, leaving projects without a seed config.
- Edit-validation UX change
  - Blocking on PostToolUse is a divergence from the original non-blocking behavior. It’s likely acceptable (and arguably better), but document this change to avoid surprises.
- External tool reliance
  - Several code paths shell out to `claude`, `gh`, `bunx ccusage`, etc. Tests appear to DI/mocks, but real usage depends on these being installed and authenticated. Failures are logged but could degrade UX.

**Required Fixes**
1) Replace absolute binary paths with portable invocations
   - In `templates/settings*.json` and `.claude/settings.json`, use `cc-track` (assumed on PATH) or a project-relative path (e.g., `./dist/cc-track`). If PATH use is preferred, add installation notes.
2) Provide `templates/track.config.json`
   - Add a default config matching the structure expected by `src/lib/config.ts` (hooks/features/logging), mirroring `.claude/track.config.json` in this repo.
3) Document the edit-validation behavior change
   - Add a short section in docs (or task notes) stating that edit validation may block with a structured `reason` and exit code, while preserving JSON output.
4) Confirm Stop hook wiring in downstream settings
   - `.claude/settings.json` includes a `Stop` hook block. Ensure project templates and install instructions reflect this so the stop reviewer actually runs.

**Optional Improvements**
- Dispatcher resilience
  - If `hook_event_name` is missing or unrecognized, log a clear notice and return `{ continue: true }` (already the behavior) and consider telemetry for misconfig stats.
- Statusline template
  - Verify template and init alignment; since `init` writes `.claude/statusline.sh`, ensure any references in docs/settings point to that path consistently.
- Docs parity note
  - Add or update a doc (e.g., `docs/*_differences_codex.md`) summarizing functional deltas (e.g., edit-validation blocking, dispatcher auto-detection) and why they’re approved.

**Verified Commands**
- Scope/diff: `git diff --stat main..HEAD` (fallback used to infer default branch), `git status`, `rg --files src`.
- Spec/files: `sed -n '1,200p' .claude/tasks/TASK_026.md`, `sed -n '1,200p' src/commands/hook.ts`, hooks and lib files opened for parity checks.
- Artifacts: Verified `dist/cc-track` exists and is an ELF binary; templates/settings reference compiled binary.
- Suggested local validation (not run here): `bun run check`, `bun test`, `dist/cc-track -h`.
