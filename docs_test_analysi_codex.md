# Test Suite Analysis — Second Pass (Codex)

This re‑validates unit tests after recent fixes, focusing on realism, mocking, coverage, and remaining gaps.

## What’s Improved
- Edit Validation
  - Uses configured commands from `.claude/track.config.json` (via `loadEditValidationConfig`).
  - Tests now assert `reason` and verify configured commands are executed.
  - Timeouts and ENOENT are handled and tested.

## Remaining Gaps (Actionable)
- src/lib/git-helpers.ts
  - Bug: `isGitRepository` and `getTaskBranch` call `execSync` that is not imported (file uses `nodeExecSync` elsewhere). This will throw at runtime when used by `complete-task`.
  - Add focused tests for these two helpers (happy/error paths), and fix implementation to use `nodeExecSync` or inject the exec function.
- src/lib/github-helpers.ts (low effort, good value)
  - Add unit tests for `switchToBranch`, `createGitHubRepo`, and `connectToGitHubRepo` (true/false paths, command composition), mirroring style used for other methods.
- src/lib/config.ts
  - Add tests for `updateConfig` and `setHookEnabled` using a temp path to avoid touching real FS.
- src/lib/logger.ts (optional)
  - Add a minimal `prettyPrint` test with stubbed console to validate routing of WARN/ERROR vs INFO.
- src/hooks/pre-compact.ts
  - Heuristic in `isErrorEntry` flags terms like “update”/“version”. Add an explicit non‑error case containing those words to pin intended behavior and avoid false positives.
- Commands coverage (nice to have)
  - `complete-task` only has option wiring tests. Consider a smoke test that stubs FS/git calls and exercises the happy path (status update, CLAUDE.md rewrite, optional squash guarded by mocks).

## File-by-file Recheck
- lib/logger.test.ts: Solid. Optional console test as above.
- lib/git-helpers.test.ts: Good coverage on core behaviors and branch/message generation. Add tests for the two standalone helpers noted above.
- lib/github-helpers.test.ts: Broad coverage; add tests for `switchToBranch`, `createGitHubRepo`, `connectToGitHubRepo` to close small holes.
- lib/config.test.ts: Defaults and feature flags covered; add mutation tests for `updateConfig`/`setHookEnabled`.
- hooks/capture-plan.test.ts: Comprehensive; no new gaps detected.
- hooks/pre-compact.test.ts: Strong; add the “update/version” non‑error case to document heuristic intent.
- hooks/post-compact.test.ts: Good; no gaps.
- hooks/edit-validation.test.ts: Updated and aligned with new behavior (configured commands + reason). Looks solid.
- hooks/stop-review.test.ts: Comprehensive; no gaps.

## Quick Fix Summary
- Fix import in `src/lib/git-helpers.ts` for `execSync` or route through `nodeExecSync` consistently.
- Add small, focused tests noted above to bring coverage to parity with refactors.

Once the git-helpers import is fixed and the few extra tests added, the suite looks in excellent shape.
