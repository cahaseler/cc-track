# Test Suite Analysis (Codex)

This report reviews all test files under `src/**/**.test.ts` for best practices, mocking strategy, coverage, and whether tests validate real behavior rather than re‑implementing logic.

## Overall
- Framework: Bun’s `bun:test` with `mock` and `mock.module` used appropriately to inject dependencies and isolate side effects (fs, child_process, config modules).
- Structure: Tests are co-located with sources, named `*.test.ts`, and focus on unit-level behavior. Edge cases and error paths are well represented across hooks and libs.
- Realism: Tests validate public surface and observable side effects (commands invoked, files written, return values). Minimal duplication of production logic beyond simple string fixtures/assertions.

## File-by-file

1) src/lib/logger.test.ts
- Strengths: Exercises level filtering, JSONL entry shape, error handling, daily filename, disabled logging, and retention cleanup via injected `FileSystemOps`.
- Mocking: Precise fs stubs; no console assertions (keeps tests stable).
- Gaps: Does not cover `prettyPrint` behavior or console routing; minor and optional. Consider 1–2 assertions behind `prettyPrint: true` with stubbed console.

2) src/lib/git-helpers.test.ts
- Strengths: Validates default branch resolution fallbacks, change detection, branch CRUD, and AI-driven message/branch generation including truncation behavior and extraction from multi-line outputs.
- Mocking: Clean injection of `exec` and file ops; asserts `cwd` and command strings where relevant.
- Gaps: Standalone helpers at bottom of `git-helpers.ts` (`isGitRepository`, `getTaskBranch`) lack tests. Note: `execSync` is referenced without import there—likely a bug. Add tests and fix implementation.

3) src/lib/github-helpers.test.ts
- Strengths: Covers `gh` availability, repo connectivity, repo info parsing, issue/PR creation (URL parsing to numbers), draft PR flag, push behavior, and integration validation (missing CLI/auth/remote).
- Mocking: Single `exec` function replaces shell; good signal assertions (e.g., command contains `--draft`).
- Gaps: No tests for `switchToBranch`, `createGitHubRepo`, or `connectToGitHubRepo` paths. Low risk but easy additions.

4) src/lib/config.test.ts
- Strengths: Exercises default structure, hook/feature defaults, unknown hook fallback, GitHub feature visibility, and cache clearing.
- Mocking: Light (relies on defaults); avoids re‑implementing logic.
- Gaps: No tests for `updateConfig` and `setHookEnabled`. Consider table-driven tests with a temp path to avoid touching real FS.

5) src/hooks/capture-plan.test.ts
- Strengths: Thorough: next task number scanning, prompt generation fields, Claude enrichment success/error with cleanup, git branching flow (commit/diff/branch), GitHub integration (issue + optional branch), CLAUDE.md updates, and hook happy/early-exit/error paths.
- Mocking: Uses `mock.module` to stub config; injects fs/exec/logger/git/github helpers with clear expectations; ensures cleanup (`unlinkSync`) occurs even on error.
- Gaps: None critical. Could add a test for when `.claude` dirs don’t exist (ensures `mkdirSync` called).

6) src/hooks/pre-compact.test.ts
- Strengths: Deep coverage of `ErrorPatternExtractor` (error detection over strings/objects/tool_result arrays; formatter/extractor helpers). Validates Claude analysis prompt path, merging with existing lessons, and resilient fallbacks on CLI failure. Hook flow covers disabled, missing transcript, read errors, and reading via mocked streams.
- Mocking: Good use of module mocks for `fs`/`readline` and timed `close` event. Uses `import` after mocks for a fresh module instance.
- Gaps: `isErrorEntry` in implementation treats words like “update/version” as error heuristics; tests don’t cover that (possible false positives). Consider an explicit non-error case containing those words to pin intent.

7) src/hooks/post-compact.test.ts
- Strengths: Validates task extraction, imported file aggregation with skips, instruction generation with/without active task, and hook early-exit inputs. Asserts logger interactions and returned `hookSpecificOutput` shape.
- Mocking: Minimal fs stubs; config stub via `mock.module`.
- Gaps: None significant.

8) src/hooks/edit-validation.test.ts
- Strengths: Unit tests for path extraction, TS file filtering variants, result formatting. Hook tests cover disabled hooks, failed tools, no-TS files, config errors, TS/biome failures, timeouts, ENOENT new-file case, and MultiEdit.
- Mocking: Injected `exec` simulates granular error codes and messages.
- Gaps: No direct tests for `loadEditValidationConfig`, `runTypeScriptCheck`, `runBiomeCheck`, or `validateFiles`. Also, `editValidation.ts` currently invokes `npx tsc/biome` in the hook instead of using configured commands—tests assume that behavior; consider aligning code to config or adding tests that verify config command usage.

9) src/hooks/stop-review.test.ts
- Strengths: Very comprehensive. Unit tests for repo checks, diff building/filtering, prompt constraints (size guard), non-task commit streaks, commit behavior, and output mapping for all review statuses. End-to-end hook scenarios: disabled, not a repo, no changes, nominal commit, deviation/needs_verification/on_track/critical_failure, timeout, and malformed AI response.
- Mocking: Clear `exec`/fs/stream stubs; realistic Claude outputs (JSON and malformed). Assertions focus on outward behavior (messages, decisions), not internal implementation.
- Gaps: None material.

## Cross-cutting observations
- Dependency injection is consistently applied to shell/fs/logging, enabling deterministic tests and preventing side effects.
- Tests rarely duplicate implementation logic; where regex-based extraction exists in production, tests feed representative inputs and assert outcomes instead of re‑parsing in tests.
- Assertions prefer observable effects (command strings, writes, returned text) over private state.

## Recommendations (actionable)
- Add small tests for:
  - `src/lib/git-helpers.ts`: `isGitRepository`, `getTaskBranch` (and fix missing `execSync` import).
  - `src/lib/github-helpers.ts`: `switchToBranch`, `createGitHubRepo`, `connectToGitHubRepo`.
  - `src/hooks/edit-validation.ts`: `loadEditValidationConfig`, `runTypeScriptCheck`, `runBiomeCheck`, `validateFiles` with representative stderr/stdout.
- Consider a `prettyPrint` console test in logger (optional).
- Clarify `isErrorEntry` heuristics for “update/version” to avoid false positives; add tests to document intent.
- Optionally snapshot very large prompts (stop-review/pre-compact) if they grow; current exact-string assertions are minimal and fine.

Overall, the test suite is strong: thoughtful mocking, robust edge coverage, and verification of real behavior. Addressing the noted small gaps will push it toward excellent completeness.
